What you need to know When a liaison, a foreign benefit application, foreign benefit decisions or documentation from a foreign institution or a client is received, you will process the information based on one of the following scenarios: If the client does not exist in Cúram, you should register the client and creates an FEC based on the information. If the client exists in the system but does not have an FEC related to the required country, you must create an FEC based on the country information. If the client exists in the system and has the specific FEC in their profile, you must update the existing FEC. You must also register the client and create the FEC if an enquiry is received for a country with which Canada does not have an International Social Security Agreement in force (e.g. a kit request for a non-agreement country). Do not register the client or create an FEC when: the account has a Country of Agreement code of 099 or 61 ; or the work item received is not related to a foreign benefit application or liaison. If the client does not exist in Cúram, they can be registered as a Person or Prospect Person. The client will be registered as a Prospect Person if: the FEC Country is one of the 3 restricted countries (the United States, Japan and Jamaica); and liaisons, foreign benefit decisions and/or documentations are received directly from one of those country's foreign institutions. When the system is registering a Prospect Person, Cúram will hide the fields related to gender and phone number.

This includes merging records with Foreign Engagement Cases (FEC) for the same and different countries. What you need to know You must mark a record as a duplicate before you can perform a record merge. R efer to Manage Duplicate Person Records in Cúram (Action) . The merge functionality is manual because it must not be used frequently. When you register a new Person in Cúram you must search to see if the record already exists to avoid issues of duplication. You cannot merge a duplicate Person when they have open tasks on their record or FECs. You must close all cases and tasks before you can proceed. You cannot merge a duplicate if there is a temporary SIN on one Person record and no SIN on the other, or if there is a temporary SIN on both records. A prospect Person record must first be registered as a Person before their record can be selected as the original record. Refer to Register a Prospect Person as a Person in Cúram (Action) . Cúram will update the Comment fields of evidences on the record to indicate that a merge was performed. All communication will be copied to the master Person’s record. Birth and Death Details, Contact Pre ferences, Gender Details, Marital Status, and Third Party Contact are not available to merge. They will need to be modified or added on the master Person’s record. Refer to Manage a Person Record in Cúram (Action) and Third Party Contacts—Add, View, Edit, and Delete in Cúram (Action) . All the FEC from the duplicate record will be added to the master record. You can still open the FECs but the home page displays the message “This case belongs to a Duplicate Person. Do not perform any updates on this case. Find the Master Person and make updates to the Master Person’s FEC.” You must recreate the FEC on the master Person’s record. You can use the duplicate FEC to recreate the information.

What you need to know When a Statement of Estimated Income after Retirement or Reduction in Pension Income Year 20XX (ISP-3041) form is received, you will use the Statement of Estimated Income wizard to create a new statement of estimated income evidence record based on the relevant details on the form. The wizard will guide you through adding the required information to create Estimated Income evidence and Estimated Income Data evidence. The information found in these 3 evidences are as follows: Table 1. Evidence types and information Evidence Information Statement of Estimated Income evidence This evidence captures the general information about the statement (e.g. estimate year, receipt date) and the event (e.g. event type, event date, reconciliation status). Only one Statement of Estimated Income evidence should exist for each estimate year. If a subsequent ISP-3041 form is received for the same estimate year, you must amend the existing statement for that year rather than create a new one. Estimated Income evidence This evidence captures the income types and frequencies of payments. A separate estimated income evidence is created for each income type. Estimated Income Data evidence This evidence captures the details of each income type (e.g. benefit rates before and after the event). A separate estimated income data evidence is created for each pension or income change in the estimate year. For example, if a client’s Registered Retirement Income Fund payments reduced twice during the estimate year, 3 estimated income data evidences are required: one for the start date and initial payment amount; and one for each payment rate reduction. Before activating the evidence in Cúram, you must review and analyze the information to ensure it is as complete and accurate as possible to avoid overpayments when the estimated income is reconciled with the actual income in the following year. For more information on analyzing the information provided on the ISP-3041, refer to Options (Scenario) . Once all updates have been applied and the evidences have been activated, Cúram will perform the option calculation based on the estimated income details that have been data captured. Cúram will use the estimated income evidences to calculate blocks 1, 2, 3, 7, 8 and 9. You must capture all income from these blocks as estimated income evidence, including non-optionable income (e.g. base calendar year) from Block 9. This income is automatically combined with the base calendar year income for blocks 4, 5 and 6 to determine the total estimated income. This total estimated income is compared to the total base year income and the most advantageous income is used to calculate entitlement for the income-tested benefit during the option period. Estimated income can be entered retroactively when the applicable base year income has been received. The statement of estimated income, estimated income and estimated income data evidences exist in both Integrated Cases and Application Cases. If an income-tested benefit is not approved, the evidences are maintained in the Application Case. If the benefit is approved, the evidences are maintained in the Integrated Case. Refer to Application Case, Integrated Case and Product Delivery Case in Cúram (Knowledge) . When the evidences are activated, even if they are not being used directly in the calculation (e.g. not to the client's advantage), the capture of this information allows the system to implement all downstream functions (e.g. creating tasks to trigger reconciliation and sending of options). Note: If a Total Payment Income override has been added to the account, ensure you review and edit the end date or delete it altogether if it affects the period covered by the estimate. Refer to Eligibility and Entitlement Override Evidence—Add, Edit, View, and Delete in Cúram (Action) . Reconciliation In some cases, Cúram will perform the option reconciliation automatically. If you are processing an "Estimated Income Reconciliation" task or you are processing an option and the actual income is available, you must manually reconcile the estimated and actual incomes and record the result in Cúram. For more information on option reconciliation, refer to KA-01448 Reconcile Options (Scenario) (article not available). To reflect the results of the manual reconciliation, update the Reconciled field by selecting: Not Applicable if at the time of processing the option, the actual income is not available for the estimate year to perform the reconciliation and : it is before renewal following the year of the estimate. It is not expected that the actual income would be received yet; or it is after renewal following the year of the estimate, but before October. It is expected that the actual income would be received. You must wait until the actual income is received to process the option and perform the reconciliation. Yes if the actual income has been received for the estimate year and you have successfully reconciled the estimated and actual incomes. This includes situations where the reconciled income is no longer to the client`s advantage. No if: it is October or later and the actual income should have been received but is not available, and the client has not responded to requests sent to submit the income information; or the actual income has been received for the estimate year but you were unable to reconcile discrepancies (e.g. the client did not respond to requests for clarification). Note: If you select No , the client’s estimated income for the affected payment period will not be used for the entitlement calculation. If the client was previously paid based on the estimated income, Cúram will recalculate the entitlement for the period of the option using the base calendar year income. Top tab: Step by Step What you need to do When a new Statement of Estimated Income after Retirement or Reduction in Pension Income Year 20XX (ISP-3041) form is received for an estimate year, you must add a new Statement of Estimated Income evidence to capture the details of the event and income. This will create the applicable Estimated Income and Estimated Income Data evidences. If a subsequent form for the same year is received or if changes are needed once the Statement of Estimated Income evidence has been created for a given year, you must edit, add or delete the existing evidences as required. New Cúram and the Options Calculator will perform the option calculation based on the estimate details that have been data captured and activated. Therefore, when you receive a Statement of Estimated Income after Retirement or Reduction in Pension Income Year 20XX (ISP-3041) form, you must review and analyze the information provided to ensure it is complete, accurate and that the details of all the applicable events have been recorded. Refer to Options (Scenario) . Data capture the client’s estimated income details in the Options Calculator . Review the information in the Options Calculator to ensure the results are as you expected. Add the statement of estimated income evidence. Refer to the Add statement of estimated income evidence section below. Add the estimated income evidence. Refer to the Add estimated income evidence section below. Add the estimated income data evidence. Refer to the Add estimated income data evidence section below. Warning: If you are updating the evidence on the Integrated Case, do not activate until you compare the client’s estimated income to the Total individual Estimated Income amount calculated via the Options Calculator and determine the amounts match. You must leave the evidence in In-edit status or there is a risk of incorrect financials being generated. For new business applications, the evidence on the Application Case can be activated but the benefit cannot be authorized until you compare the client’s estimated income to the Total individual Estimated Income amount calculated via the Options Calculator and determine the amounts match. Compare the estimated amount from the Options Calculator to the individual estimated income amount calculated in Cúram. To view the estimated income in Cúram: Proceed according to the type of case you are working on: On an Application Case, go to Step b . On an Integrated Case, access the Product Delivery Case, then go to Step b . Click Check Eligibility in the top right-hand corner of the screen. Proceed according to the type of case you are working on: On an Application Case, click Yes . On an Integrated Case, ensure the Use Active Evidence Only box is unchecked and click Save . Click the Coverage Period that is expected to be calculated on the estimated income. Click the Income tab to view the estimated income. Determine if the amounts match. If yes, you must activate the evidence or authorize the Application Case. Refer to the Activate estimated income evidence section below. If no, you must enter an Individual Payment Income entitlement override for the total individual payment income calculated by the Options Calculator . Refer to Eligibility and Entitlement Override Evidence—Add, Edit, View, and Delete in Cúram (Action) . Enter the total option income. Enter the duration of the option (i.e. the period the income should be applied). Once the override is activated, you must activate the evidences or authorize the Application Case. When adding your note in ITRDS regarding the results of processing the option, ensure you include that an override was added in Cúram using the results from the Excel Options Calculator .

What you need to know There are several situations when you can search for a Person or Prospect Person, such as: searching for a Person for specific evidence; adding evidence to the Person's records; and verifying if a Person already exists in Cúram before creating a new profile.

You must verify the client’s name before selecting an account from the search results. If a search for a client in Cúram using their SIN is unsuccessful, you must also search using their first name, last name and one of the search criteria to prevent creating a duplicate profile. Correspondence Tracking Number (Cúram generated number assigned to a specific correspondence) Either First Name , Last Name or both, and at least one of the following search criteria: Date of Birth Province , Territory , State or Region Country Postal or ZIP Code Country Code , Area Code and Phone Number Note: If you search using any names with accents or special characters (e.g. hyphens, apostrophes, periods, and spaces), the search results will only display the regular letters without the accents or special characters in Cúram. If the correct spelling of the first and/or last names is unknown, you can place a % as a placeholder for unknown character (e.g. "Smith" can be "%mith", "S%th", and "Smi%").

What you need to know Before registering a client as a person, you must search and verify if the client already exists in Cúram. To do an effective person search, refer to Search for a Person in Cúram (Action) . If the client does not have an account in Cúram as a person, you must create a person record in Cúram before taking action on their account. The process of creating a person record in Cúram is called registration. If applicable, after you finish the registration process, you can enter the client's International Agreement number as an Identification Evidence. Refer to the Add a person's Identification section in the What you need to do section of the Step by Step tab in Manage a Person Record in Cúram (Action) and select IA Account Number as the Type . The mandatory information required to register a person in Cúram includes: first and last names; gender; date of birth; preferred languages in oral and written communication; and residential and mailing addresses. In Cúram, some person-level evidence types require verification, such as SIN, names, date of birth and so on. If there is a SIN in a person's profile, Cúram will automatically perform verification via Social Insurance Register (SIR). If the SIN does not match the SIR, Cúram will create a task to request verification of the SIN. If there is no SIN in a person's profile, Cúram will create a task to request validation on name or date of birth.

What you need to know The CRA lifetime list evidence records information about a client's lifetime status based on the information provided on the applicant OAS income tested benefits applications. The GIS , ALW , ALWS and OAS pension application should not be included in the evidence records. This is important as the combined OAS pension and the GIS or the ALW or ALWS benefit application case is being created even when the client indicates no to GIS . Note: This is available also when using the XXX/Canada Agreement - Application for Canadian Old Age, Retirement and Survivors Benefits (SC ISP-5054-XXX) form. This evidence records new information for any changes in the client's CRA reported lifetime list status for the request made from the client's case. You can view the status of CRA lifetime list evidence under the Evidence tab in the client's profile. A manual request to add or delete a client to the CRA lifetime list is only required when Cúram does not automatically add or delete the client from the CRA lifetime list. This happens when the CRA is not responding to the verification request (e.g. response is delayed, the website is down). A manual request is also required when a client and/or spouse/common-law partner applied for the OAS pension and the GIS or the ALW or ALWS benefit and the spouse's/common-law partner's signature is not on file. Note: Cúram will send the CRA request based on the application case. Cúram will also send a request to add the spouse to the CRA lifetime list when the spouse or common-law signature is on file.

If foreign income is received that needs to be counted toward a client's entitlement determination, the amount is entered into Manually Reported Income. The foreign income evidence Amount field is meant to gather the raw data as submitted by the client, meaning this should reflect the appropriate numeric value for the currency of the income. Manual conversion to Canadian Dollars would be completed before entering that amount in manually reported income evidence to be used in entitlement calculation. Refer to Manually Entered Income Evidence—Add, Edit, View and Delete in Cúram (Action) .

What you need to know A benefit suspension evidence is used to temporarily pause payments of a benefit on the Integrated Case Evidence. The evidence allows the suspension of individual benefits or all benefits. A suspension may be completely lifted or partially lifted. Note: Deleting a suspension will unsuspend the benefit. This should only be done if the evidence was incorrectly put on the client's case. You cannot initiate a retroactive suspension as it is simply stopping the entitlement from going out. Retroactively, it is already gone. To suspend moving forward - add suspension evidence with a Suspension Status of Suspended . To Unsuspend moving forward but leave the period (from the suspension start date) suspended - add an end date to the evidence. To unsuspend and release all entitlements previously blocked - change the Suspension status to Unsuspended . Note: The suspend and unsuspend actions are done manually. A benefit suspension evidence will cause the current determination to display entitlement amount to be $0.00, suspension reason being lack of entitlement. Note: A benefit suspension cannot be applied for any period in which a payment has already been issued. When unsuspending a benefit, you must determine if the client is underpaid or overpaid. This will be transmitted in the notification letter that is manually sent out. When unsuspending all benefits in the integrated case or suspending a specific benefit, you must apply changes to both benefits at the same time, regardless of which benefits are involved. This is necessary to stop a payment from accidentally being issued on the benefit you would want to remain suspended.

What you need to know You can create an ALW and ALWS application from a person's record or prospect person's record. You can add an ALW and ALWS application form with the information found in the Application for the Allowance or Allowance for the Survivor - Under the Old Age Security Program (ISP-3008) or the Application for Allowance Under the Old Age Security Program (ISP-3033) form provided by the client. After you submit the application form, an Application Case will automatically be created under the Cases and Applications tab. Refer to OAS/GIS Application Case—View, Authorize, Reopen and Print in Cúram (Action) . In order to send correspondence to the client to request missing information, in cases of incomplete applications, the application must be added in Curam to create an Application Case. It is necessary to capture consent for the spouse in the Application Case. If consent has already been provided in a previous application, this can be referenced from past data. If no prior consent exists, new consent must be obtained. The Consent and Declaration evidence captures this information and can be found on the Evidence Dashboard of the Application Case. The full period of the marital relationship must be entered to determine entitlement for ALW or ALWS . When a spouse’s date of death is added to the ALW or ALWS Application Case , the  applicant’s Marital Status evidence is set to Survivor when the application is submitted. Note: When a date of death is entered in Cúram either manually or from the CRA, a task is generated to reconcile this evidence with all cases and applications to which the deceased individual might be party. If the spouse has been deceased for 12 months or more from the application Receipt Date , and a Marital Relationship evidence issue is created, you can delete the evidence and proceed with processing the application. If the spouse’s death date is less than 12 months from the application receipt date, the spouse must remain on the application case with complete marital relationship details, income information, and date of death. Complete a manual check of eligibility before authorizing ALW or ALWS benefits to see the potential outcome of authorization. This creates a potential eligibility check on the Application Case with a detailed summary of all criteria assessed to determine eligibility. The evidence dashboard of the application case will indicate any evidence that needs to be verified before authorization can occur, including marital status.

What you need to know Each person in Cúram should have only one record. If a duplicate record is created, (e.g. when a client's name is changed and a person search does not find a match), the duplicate record must be resolved. Refer to Search for a Person in Cúram (Action) . Duplicate records must be merged into a single master record for that person so that the master record can be a single source of reliable data on that person. It is important to note that merging records is a manual function and must not be used frequently. Marking a person record as duplicate You must mark a record as a duplicate before you can merge records. Before marking a record as a duplicate, you must decide which of the records is the master and which is the secondary. To determine which person record should be the master, consider the following: which account has the most amount of accurate information. if one record has a permanent SIN (100-899 series) and the other does not: Person merge is not allowed when the master record has a temporary SIN and duplicate person record has a non-SIN Identifier or no SIN. In this case, by making the non-SIN identifier or no SIN the master, you will be able to perform the merge using the Merge Person wizard. Person merge is not allowed when both the master and duplicate records have a temporary SIN. In this case, you will not be able to use the Merge Person wizard. However, you can still mark one of the records as a duplicate using the steps outlined in the What You Need to do section. You can then manually recreate the evidence on the master record. if either profile has any applications: If neither profile has any applications, the profile with the earliest record should be the master record. If one profile has applications and the other does not, the profile with applications should be the master record. if both profiles have applications, the profile with the earliest record should be the master record. if there are two records where one is a registered person and the other is a prospect person, the record where one is a registered person must always be the master record. A prospect record cannot be a master record. If 2 prospect records need to be merged, you need to decide which will be the master record and upgrade it to a registered person first. Refer to Register a Prospect Person as a Person in Cúram (Action) . the information on ITRDS . Once you have identified the master and the secondary records, you must do the following, as applicable: Close all open tasks on the duplicate record before starting the merge process. Confirm that the evidence periods of the records do not overlap. If there is an overlap, update the evidence on the master profile and then create any manual overpayments. Any underpayments will be issued by Cúram. If updated evidences result in any payment corrections, Cúram will automatically create the payment corrections as underpayment or overpayment. However, Cúram will not recognize entitlement that was already paid on the duplicate record so any monetary that is calculated may need to be offset towards the overpayment to bring the account into balance. Refer to Liability Offset—Create, Complete and Delete in Cúram (Action) . If there are any applications on the duplicate record, you must recreate them on the master record. Take screenshots of the evidence and case information from the duplicate record and upload the screenshots as attachment in the master record. If these records need to be unmerged later due to an error, the screenshots will assist in re-creating the evidence and case information on the duplicate record. Refer to Attachments—Add, View, Modify, Delete, Move and Search in Cúram (Action) . Once the record is marked as a duplicate, you use a wizard to merge the records' person level evidence. If there are any application cases on the duplicate record, you must manually recreate them on the master record. Both person records remain visible, but one is marked as a duplicate in the context panel. You will be able to toggle to a duplicate record via the master record by clicking on the Administration tab, but you will not be able to do the same on the duplicate record. In addition, the search results will also identify a duplicate record via a duplicate icon. The duplicate person record will no longer be used in case processing, and you cannot make changes to it. The cases on the duplicate record will still exist, however, the cases will be in a view only mode and the following message will display on the Home page: "This case belongs to a duplicate person. Do not perform any updates on this case." Cúram will display a comment to indicate that a merge was performed for any person level evidence that were merged through the wizard. All communication and attachments will be copied over to the master record. Note: During merging, most of the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) marital status, CRA birth and death details and CRA lifetime list evidence cannot be merged to the master person record since they are read-only fields. Unmarking a person record marked as duplicate in error If a record was marked as a duplicate in error, you can unmark it. This will unmerge the records if they have been previously merged and it can be used in case processing again. The record will no longer be marked as a duplicate. Unmarking does not remove any of the merged data that was copied into the original record if a merge was already performed. You must manually delete any evidence brought over from the secondary account and close any cases. You may also have to re-adjust the financials, amend tax slips, etc., depending on the situation. Cúram will add a comment to the evidence to indicate that the evidence record is from a duplicate account. Guidelines for Determining the Master Record Use the following guidelines to determine which record should be considered the master record: Table 1—Guidelines for Determining the Master Record Situation Action Person A has one or multiple Foreign Engagement Cases (FEC). Person B has one or multiple Application Case (OAS/ GIS / ALW / ALWS ) that has not been authorized (not withdrawn, denied, closed, or approved). Identify Master record. Master: Person A–FEC exists. Merge Person B into Person A. Note: Ultimately, this is a judgement call by the Employment and Social Development Canada representative as there could be other hinderances (e.g. a temporary SIN that may need to be taken into consideration). Add the proper Application Case to the master person record. Refer to the following procedures: Add an OAS and GIS Application Form in Cúram (Action) Add an ALW or ALWS Application Form in Cúram (Action) Person A has one or multiple FECs. Person B has one or more Application Cases (OAS/ GIS / ALW / ALWS ) where one has been authorized. Identify Master record. Master: Person B–OAS authorized Merge Person A into Person B. Recreate the FECs in the master person record. Refer to the following procedures: Foreign Engagement Case—Add, View, Edit and Close in Cúram (Action) Foreign Application—Add, Access, Modify, and Delete in Cúram (Action) Foreign Creditable Period—Add, View, Edit or Delete in Cúram (Action) Liaison—Add, Modify, Access and Delete in Cúram (Action) Residence Period—Add, View and Edit in Cúram (Action) Person A has OAS pension in pay. Person B has OAS pension in pay. This also applies if both persons are both receiving OAS and GIS . Identify the Master record. The master record is the one with the earliest effective date. Create or update any applicable case-level evidences on the master person record (this includes FECs). Review the past payments in the duplicate person record and manually calculate the overpayment amount, if applicable. This must include all money that was paid on the duplicate record that Cúram will calculate underpayments for on the master record. Create the overpayment in the master person record. Refer to Overpayment (Manual) Case—Add, View, Edit, Suspend and Delete in Cúram (Action) . Apply any underpayments or arrears payments calculated by the updated evidences to the overpayment using a void offset resulting in a debt adjustment not collection. Refer to Liability Offset—Create, Complete and Delete in Cúram (Action) . Note: If the underpayments or arrears payments are not overlapping with the period paid on the duplicate, they must be applied as a non-void offset to be treated as monies collected towards the debt. Recreate any other liabilities (i.e. existing departmental liabilities, cross program recoveries, Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) set offs, etc.) on the master record. Refer to Overpayment (Manual) Case—Add, View, Edit, Suspend and Delete in Cúram (Action) . Refer to Liability Allocation—View, Create, Deactivate, Reactivate and Delete in Cúram (Action) . Note: If updated evidences result in any payment corrections, Cúram will automatically create the payment corrections as underpayment or overpayment. However, Cúram will not recognize entitlement that was already paid on the duplicate record so any monetary that is calculated may need to be offset towards the overpayment to bring the account into balance. Refer to Liability Offset—Create, Complete and Delete in Cúram (Action) . Note: Steps 4 and 5 are essential to not overpay the client. Person A has OAS pension and/or benefits in pay (OAS/ GIS ). Person B has OAS pension in pay. Identify the master record. Person A becomes the Master. Merge Person B into Person A (always merge into the one with the benefits due to the large interface data that will not transfer over–CRA income etc.). Create or update any applicable case-level evidences on the master person record (this includes FECs). Review the past payments in the duplicate person record and manually calculate the overpayment amount, if applicable. This must include all money that was paid on the duplicate record that Cúram will calculate underpayments for on the master record. Create the overpayment in the master person record. Refer to Overpayment (Manual) Case—Add, View, Edit, Suspend and Delete in Cúram (Action) . Apply any underpayments or arrears payments calculated by the updated evidences to the overpayment using a void offset resulting in a debt adjustment not collection. Refer to Liability Offset—Create, Complete and Delete in Cúram (Action) . Note: If the underpayments or arrears payments are not overlapping with the period paid on the duplicate, they must be applied as a non-void offset to be treated as monies collected towards the debt. Recreate any other liabilities (i.e. existing departmental liabilities, cross program recoveries, CRA set offs, etc.) on the master record. Note: If updated evidences result in any payment corrections, Cúram will automatically create the payment corrections as underpayment or overpayment. However, Cúram will not recognize entitlement that was already paid on the duplicate record so any monetary that is calculated may need to be offset towards the overpayment to bring the account into balance. Refer to Liability Offset—Create, Complete and Delete in Cúram (Action) . Refer to Liability Allocation—View, Create, Deactivate, Reactivate and Delete in Cúram (Action) . Note: Steps 4 and 5 are essential to not overpay the client. Person A has OAS pension and/or benefits in pay. Person B has OAS pension and/or benefits in pay and departmental overpayments (including penalties and interest). Identify the master record. Person B becomes the Master record. Merge Person A into Person B (always merge to the one with the overpayments due to the interface with Public Sector Collections and Disbursements and the history of debt collection). Create or update any applicable case-level evidences on the master person record (this includes FECs). Review the past payments in the duplicate person record and manually calculate the overpayment amount, if applicable. This must include all money that was paid on the duplicate record that Cúram will calculate underpayments for on the master record. Create the overpayment in the master person record. Refer to Overpayment (Manual) Case—Add, View, Edit, Suspend and Delete in Cúram (Action) . Apply any underpayments or arrears payments calculated by the updated evidences to the overpayment using a void offset resulting in a debt adjustment not collection. Refer to Liability Offset—Create, Complete and Delete in Cúram (Action) . Note: If the underpayments or arrears payments are not overlapping with the period paid on the duplicate, they must be applied as a non-void offset to be treated as monies collected towards the debt. Recreate any other liabilities (i.e. existing departmental liabilities, cross program recoveries, CRA set offs, etc.) on the master record. Note: If updated evidences result in any payment corrections, Cúram will automatically create the payment corrections as underpayment or overpayment. However, Cúram will not recognize entitlement that was already paid on the duplicate record so any monetary that is calculated may need to be offset towards the overpayment to bring the account into balance. Refer to Liability Offset—Create, Complete and Delete in Cúram (Action) . Refer to Liability Allocation—View, Create, Deactivate, Reactivate and Delete in Cúram (Action) . Note: Steps 4 and 5 are essential to not overpay the client. Person A has records of active overpayments. Person B also has records of active overpayments. Choose the one that will create the least amount of monetary impacts taking into consideration all the evidence, payment etc. Note: If the Person only has a departmental overpayment as a non-beneficiary debtor, then this account should become the duplicate record. In addition to the steps above, when you create the manual overpayments on the master record, you will only create for the outstanding balance (not the original liability amount). Furthermore, you will need to write off any debts on the duplicate account for reason reallocation once they have been recreated on the master record. In any case if you are unsure consult with your Business Expertise community or National Headquarters as required.

You can reserve unassigned tasks (i.e. tasks that are not assigned to anyone) under the Tasks tab in the person's profile or in the case level to yourself by using the Add to My Tasks function. The reserved task will be displayed under My Open Tasks . This function provides a convenient way for you to quickly take on related tasks for a person or a case you are working on, without the requirement of having the tasks assigned to you beforehand. In addition to being able to reserve tasks to yourself, those with workload management access can reserve unassigned tasks to staff members directly from the person's profile or in the case level. You can reserve the tasks to others using the Reserve Tasks function. This function provides a fast way to reserve relevant tasks to a staff member who works on the same case.

What you need to know First entry into Canada details evidence is used to record a client's port of entry to Canada and the date of entry. A case will have only one first entry into Canada details evidence. If the client indicates they were not born in Canada on their application, the evidence is created in Cúram automatically. If the client does not provide all first entry information, Cúram creates an issue on the Application Case that must be resolved by adding the date, city and province of arrival, and the type of immigration documentation used. Note: First entry into Canada details evidence is not used directly by eligibility and entitlement rules. The evidence exists in both Application Cases and Integrated Cases. If the OAS benefit is not approved, the first entry into Canada details evidence is maintained in the Application Case.

What you need to know After a task is created by Cúram, it is automatically allocated to a work queue where it can be reserved to a user if: the user has the required skills to complete the new task. OR the user has one or more reserved tasks for the same client; and the user has the required skills to complete the new task. Note: Manually created tasks are not automatically allocated. Note: Integrity-related tasks are not automatically allocated. The Integrity Services Branch (ISB) tasks will be manually allocated through the ISB region's workload distribution team. You can use the Get Next Task... function to add tasks to your Open Tasks list from your Inbox or from a Manual Work Queue: From the Inbox If you are usually assigned work through automatic allocation and have no open tasks assigned, you can contact the team lead to assign more work or use the Get Next Task... function from your Inbox. Cúram will prioritize the tasks in the automatic work queue that correspond to your region and reserve the next priority task that matches your location, language, and skill type. Tasks are prioritized as High, Medium and Low and sorted within the priority group as follows: Receipt Date (oldest to newest) Creation Date (oldest to newest) Due Date (oldest to newest) If more than one automated work queue is applicable, Cúram sorts across all applicable automated work queues as one. Note: You will not receive tasks through automatic allocation if you do not have your skills set up. From a Manual Work Queue If you are usually required to add tasks to your Open Tasks list from a manual work queue, you can use Get Next Task… from the selected manual work queue to prompt Cúram to allocate the next priority task. Cúram will prioritize the tasks in the manual work queue that match your language and reserve the most prioritized task. Note: The Get Next Task... from a manual work queue is to be generally used when working on manual workload or campaign queues and you must be subscribed to the manual work queue by your team lead. Tasks are grouped by High, Medium and Low priority and sorted within the priority group as follows: Receipt Date (oldest to newest) Creation Date (oldest to newest) Due Date (oldest to newest) Note: When a Mailroom Clerk receives a new document for upload, Cúram will create a new task which will go to the allocation batch. If the new task's Skill Type matches the Skill Type of the officer allocated to another task for the same client, Cúram will bundle the tasks to the officer. Note: If you are usually assigned work through automatic allocation, you need to be aware that there is a Maximum Task Threshold rule applied in Curam. This means that if your Open Tasks reach the max task threshold of 30 tasks, the batch run will no longer seek to reserve tasks for you. When the automatic allocation batch has assigned a task to a user, it will scan the remaining unreserved tasks for the same client to see which can be bundled to the same user provided they have the skillset to complete the task. Bundling rules do not validate against the max task threshold (30 tasks), meaning that a user can still receive a task via bundling if they are at their max task limit (30 tasks).

What you need to know A person's residential and/or mailing address needs to be captured upon registration. Once on file, the address can be viewed, edited, or removed. An address must always remain on a Person or Prospect Person's profile. Mailing and residential addresses can be adjusted separately. If a client wants to add a new mailing address only, the residential address can remain as is. Current mailing addresses are mandatory in Cúram. However, future dated addresses can be edited. When editing current addresses, Cúram will require activation to make the address effective, but activation is not required upon registration. Once you save a new address, Cúram automatically assigns an end date to the old address. The end date of an old address in Cúram cannot overlap with the start date of a new address. When receiving an address change request, use the current date as the start date, not the date of receipt (if earlier). Note: Cúram allows for diverse ways of adding or editing addresses. This article focuses on one of the possible ways. Post Office box used as residential address When updating or capturing an address, start by searching with the postal code provided by the client. The system will display the results. If a client or applicant provides a PO Box address as their home address, you must request confirmation of their address their civic address or physical location. Refer to Post Office Boxes (Action) . Once the confirmation has been received, instead of selecting one of the search results after entering the postal code, click on Add New Address . This will display a second page where you can capture the address manually in the below format: Example Civic Number: LOT 40 Street Name: Concession 1 City, Town, or Village: Bight Province, Territory, State or Region: Newfoundland Postal Code: A0E1B0 For clients using a Postal Office box as their residential address in the United States, you may capture the Postal Office box as a residential address too. For clients living in countries outside of Canada and the United States, addresses will be captured as Address Line 1, Address Line 2, and Address Line 3, with PO box addresses being captured under Address Line 1. Address guidelines To reduce the cost and the volume of returned correspondence for CPP and OAS operations, it is important that you review and record and/or enter the person's address accurately. The most common error in address formatting is the apartment or suite number. The correct format for a Canadian address with an apartment or suite number requires it to appear before the civic address number, with a hyphen in between, without spaces and without the word "suite" or the "#" symbol. New Note: You must not enter “C/O” in the Unit/Apt/Suite Number field when adding or updating an address, as this will cause an error in the Public Sector Collections and Disbursements system. The Third Party Contact evidence has a field which allows you to select who receives correspondence for the client (i.e. Client Only , Client and Third Party , or Third Party ). Based on your selection, the name of the Third Party will appear in the Create Correspondence field when correspondence is sent.

What you need to know Non-resident tax is a deduction in Cúram and is applied to OAS benefits. The non-resident tax default varies between 10% and 25% of the OAS benefits, depending on whether there is a tax treaty with the applicable country in place or in cases where there is an approved request for a non-resident tax reduction. Note: The country in which a client resides determines whether the non-resident tax is applicable or not. A non-resident tax withhold deduction is automatically created when an OAS benefits product delivery case is created for a client whose current and/or future residential address is not within Canada, United States or the United Kingdom. Note: A non-resident tax withhold deduction will not be created against a foreign residential address evidence in a person evidence case that is end-dated before the benefit starts. Cúram automatically creates or updates the deduction based on trigger events. The default non-resident tax withhold deduction will be configured as a third-party variable deduction on the OAS product delivery case. The residential address evidence or the non-residential tax correction evidence provides the start date, end date and percentage of the non-resident tax withhold deduction. The trigger events that update the non-resident tax withhold deduction are: Table 1—Trigger events that update the non-resident tax withhold deductions, event and description Trigger event Description Deemed non-resident Non-resident clients can request a reduction in the amount of non-resident tax required to be withheld from the CRA . On approval of the request, the CRA informs the Department of the non-resident tax rate reduction. Deemed resident A deemed resident is not subjected to the non-resident tax. The CRA identifies deemed residents each year and sends a list of these clients to the Department. Retroactive recovery of the non-resident tax (current year only) This is required in situations where: The client's foreign residential address is entered retroactively. Past payments are already processed. The agent determines that a higher non-resident tax deduction rate is required for this client to recover what was previously not deducted. The CRA requests an increase of the rate of the non-resident tax withhold of a specific client. Such an increase may occur because the CRA has received additional income information following an original decision to reduce the withhold rate. Note: The non-resident tax evidence manages the non-resident tax correction scenarios. Tax treaty non-resident tax rate change In the event of the change in the non-resident tax rate, Cúram sets the end date for the current non-resident tax and creates new non-resident tax withhold deductions through a batch process. The batch is manually triggered to create or update deductions. Once the batch is run, Cúram updates the existing non-resident tax withhold deduction based on the values provided in the evidence.

What you need to know The OAS recovery tax is a tax on higher-income OAS pensioners whose individual net income, for a given base taxation year, is above the threshold determined by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). It is applicable for both Canadian residents and non-residents. The CRA will send the information regarding the OAS Recovery Tax Deduction through an established interface or through other non-interface channels, like paper communication. Note: The CRA is the only trusted source for the OAS recovery tax information. The OAS recovery tax evidence in Cúram is added on Integrated Case and used to record the OAS recovery tax information received from the CRA. Once it is activated, Cúram uses this evidence to create the OAS Recovery Tax Deduction on the client's payment and/or benefit. Note: OAS recovery tax evidence should only be added and edited when you are instructed by the CRA. Note: Changes cannot be made to the CRA deduction record directly. The OAS recovery tax evidence can be deleted if the deduction has not been included in the financial payment issuance run. If the OAS recovery tax evidence is deleted, the associated deduction record will also be deleted. Note: Only use the Delete function in exceptional circumstances (e.g. when the information was recorded on an incorrect client account). Generally, Edit function is used to manage the existing evidence. Top tab: Step by Step What you need to do H2 Exp-coll: Add OAS recovery tax evidence In Cúram, go to the client's profile.

What you need to know The Pension Trusted Digital Repository (PTDR) is the document repository system where documents are saved. When the mailroom receives documents, the Mailroom clerk will upload the documents in the PTDR. Once the documents are saved in the PTDR, the repository will send the information to Cúram. Cúram will run batch process to retrieve the documents scanned to the PTDR and upload the documents as attachments in Cúram under the Contacts tab in the person profile. Cúram will create a task for the mailroom clerk. At first, the documents in the Attachments page under the Contacts tab only display Other as the document type. The mailroom clerk will triage the documents and update the type of the document appropriately. Subsequently, Cúram will generate a task for Processing to review the attachments and move the attachments to the correct place (e.g. a specific case, verification and appeal). Cúram stores attachments in various places, including: Person/prospect profile External party Foreign Engagement Case Application Case Product Delivery Case Integrated Case Overpayment case Underpayment case Verifications Appeals When required, you can also manually add an attachment to a person, prospect person, external party, verification and all cases. When a document is uploaded into Cúram, the document will be sent to PTDR for storage and an attachment is created to represent the document in Cúram. The attachment links to the document in PTDR so that it can be viewed if needed. However, attachments added to Cúram (without a document uploaded) will not be transmitted to the PTDR as records.

What you need to know Cúram creates an overpayment case when an individual has received more OAS benefits than they were entitled to. Staff members can also manually create overpayments. There are 2 types of overpayment cases in Cúram: Table 1—Types and Descriptions of Cúram overpayment cases Type Description Benefit Overpayment cases A Benefit Overpayment case is created automatically when a recalculation is completed on previously-paid benefits in Cúram. Manual overpayment Manual overpayment cases are created by staff members. Refer to Overpayment (Manual) Case—Add, View, Edit, Suspend and Delete in Cúram (Action) . After each recalculation of a client's eligibility and entitlement, Cúram creates a Benefit Overpayment case if the benefits the client received at a given time were determined to be too high. The case created in this way covers all OAS pension or benefit types that a client has that have been affected by that recalculation. For example, if the client has both the OAS pension and the GIS , and both are overpaid, then one Benefit Overpayment case will be created to combine both debts. Each debt will appear as a separate line item. If the same client is determined to be overpaid after a future recalculation of eligibility and entitlements, then another Benefit Overpayment case will be created. Separate Benefit Overpayment cases will be created if the client is overpaid different benefits (such as OAS and GIS ) for different periods. You can suspend and unsuspend Benefit Overpayment cases. When a case is suspended, any related deduction will be deactivated, and the max deduction amount will be recalculated. When a suspended Benefit Overpayment case is unsuspended, Cúram recalculates the max deduction amount and reactivates any applicable deduction. Migration of overpayment cases will not be combined with Payment corrections. You must continue to follow previous guidance for overpayment recovery, especially for cases involving deceased clients. Benefit Overpayment cases contain the following tabs: Table 2—Tab Names and Details in a Benefit Overpayment Case Tab Name Detail Home The Home tab consists of 3 sections: Case Details Comments Recent Transactions The Case Details section provides a summary of the client, benefits, owner, certification frequency, status, overpayment reason, maximum deduction amount, fraud or misrepresentation, billing pattern and creation date. The Comments section displays any comments entered in this case. The Recent Transactions section documents all the actions that were taken on this case. Tasks The Tasks tab displays the tasks related to the Benefit Overpayment case. Contacts The Contacts tab consists of the following pages: Communications Attachments The Communications page contains recorded enquiries and letters sent to the clients related to the Benefit Overpayment case. The Attachments page contains all the links to the documentation stored in the Pension Trusted Digital Repository (e.g. application, supporting documents) associated with the Benefit Overpayment case. Financials The Financials tab consists of the following pages: Transactions Deductions The Transactions page lists the information of liabilities, cash receipts and benefit deduction made on the Benefit Overpayment case. The Deductions page lists deductions applied against the client's benefits to settle the overpayment.

What you need to know Updated When a client has an overpayment or liability related to OAS (e.g. an interest or penalty debt), it is important to prioritize reducing the outstanding balance for these debts using any underpayment or arrears owing to the client. Only after this reduction should the remaining underpayment or arrears funds be paid to the client. New The following tasks are automatically generated to identify opportunities to reduce an overpayment by applying an underpayment or arrears: Table 1. Automatically generated tasks and description Task Description New Underpayment activation New This task is triggered when an underpayment is created and there is an existing overpayment. New Overpayment activation New This task is triggered when an overpayment is created and there is an existing underpayment. Updated The Liability Offset section of the Financials tab of the Person's record displays records for liability offsets related to underpayment and arrears components of each benefit type in a product delivery case. Each record has 3 action items: Approve ; Complete ; and Delete . Updated The Liability Offset wizard is the mechanism used to apply any underpayment or retroactive amounts to reduce the outstanding amount of departmental overpayments (e.g. penalty, interest, manual overpayment, payment correction-overpaid liabilities). It allows you to enter an offset amount that will be deducted from the liability. Updated The first page of the Liability Offset wizard is used to input offset details. You must input the approved offset amount, which represents the maximum amount of the underpayment that can be applied to the overpayment. New You can apply one underpayment or arrears owing to a client to multiple overpayments and they can be void and non-void, as required. Updated The second page of the Liability Offset wizard is used to specify the offset amount to be applied to each departmental overpayment (e.g. penalty, interest, manual overpayment, payment correction-overpaid liabilities), as applicable. You cannot enter an offset amount that exceeds the outstanding amount of the liability. Additionally, you cannot enter a total offset amount that exceeds the outstanding amount of the offset entered on the first page of the Liability Offset wizard. Clicking Save on this page creates a Liability Offset Item. New Note: When you apply one underpayment or arrears to multiple overpayments, you must create a separate offset for each overpayment. Do not complete the offset until you have finished creating all offsets. Void offset New A void offset is used to fix financial errors caused by mistakes when entering and applying evidence, or for internal balancing. Void offsets do not appear on client records or tax slips. Instead of deductions, they are reported to the Public Sector Collections and Disbursements (PSCD) system as debt adjustments and reduces the overpayment amount that was originally sent. They must match the benefit type and coverage period. The void offset is found in the Liability Offset wizard. You can also check the Void Offset box for Underpayment Liability Offset records. In cases where a Payment Correction-Overpaid case is created due to an error and an underpayment is generated after correcting the error, you can offset the underpayment using the Payment Correction-Overpaid liability and check the Void Offset box. This creates a liability offset item to void the mistakenly generated underpayment amount. If the Void Offset box is checked, you can only offset Payment Correction-Overpaid and Manual Overpayment liabilities for the Underpayment Liability Offset for the same coverage period. Non-void offset New Non-void offset (i.e. when the Void Offset box is not checked) is treated as a recovery and recorded as payment toward the overpayment. The non-void offset transaction will: be reported to the Public Sector Collections and Disbursements system; affect Year to Date and gross pension amounts; impact the tax slips; and be recorded as a recovered overpayment amount. Note: Encoding a write-off reallocation to remove these impacts on the tax slips will not completely resolve the issues. Any balances from the non-void offset will appear in automatically generated letters and letters created manually in the Corporate Correspondence Tool. If you encounter a situation where you need to check the Void Offset box and it is greyed it out, you must submit a National Service Desk Internal link technical ticket. No further actions should be taken until this ticket is resolved. Note: For the renewal of benefits, the recovery from arrears must be applied as follows: If the information is received by December 31, or if the client is claiming dire need, only recover an amount equal to what would have been recovered if the benefit had not been interrupted, taking into account any amount already recovered from the OAS pension payment for the arrears period. If the required income information is received January 1 or later and the client is not claiming dire need, apply the full arrears to the overpayment. The available statuses of the liability offset records on the Liability Offset list screen are: Table 2–—Statuses of Liability Offset Records Status Details Pending Approval The Pending Approval status is displayed when the Delegation of Authority has completed a batch run for the liability offset record, which creates arrears and underpayment records on the Liability Offset List screen for the corresponding arrear coverage period. In this case, you may approve the liability offset record. Pending Offset The Pending Offset status is displayed: when there are liabilities to offset, and you click the Approved action in the liability record's menu. while awaiting the Offset Delegation of Authority process. during a Delegation of Authority and Offset batch, when Delegation of Authority approval is not needed and there are liabilities that must be offset, the pending Offset status will be displayed. Completed The Completed status is displayed: when the offset is approved. when you click Save on the Offset wizard and the offset amount available is 0. when you click the Complete action menu. Processed The Processed status is displayed when the offset has been processed. Cancelled The Cancelled status is displayed when a new entitlement has been determined for this arrears period. New If there is an overpayment in both Cúram and CPMS and a cross program recovery is required, do not complete the liability offset until the cross program recovery is finalized. Refer to Cross Program Recovery (Scenario) . New Ensure to close the associated task once you have completed all the required actions.

There are 2 types of recovery rates used in gross to net processing in Cúram: Table 1—Type and Description of Fixed and Variable Recovery Rate Type Description Recovery Rate Fixed ($) Recovery rate fixed is a predetermined fixed dollar amount that represents the deduction to be considered during the processing. This fixed amount is deducted from the gross amount. Note: If the client is receiving benefits on a non-standard payment schedule (e.g. semi-annual), the fixed recovery rate used must reflect the amount to be deducted from the payment at the time of payment issuance, rather than the monthly amount. Recovery Rate Variable (%) Recovery rate variable is referred to as a percentage. This percentage is used to calculate the deduction amount based on the gross amount. Note: The recovery rate displayed in Cúram is dependent on the type of recovery rate selected (fixed or variable).

What you need to know Clients can use the client portal to apply for, update and track the status of their application for the OAS pension and benefits. Clients can access their correspondence sent from OAS and receive notifications through the portal. The client portal features allow clients to submit required information during the initial benefit application, update life events information and submit requests for reconsideration. H2 Exp-coll: Initial benefit application Clients can apply for the following pension and benefits through the client portal: OAS pension; GIS ; and ALW or ALWS benefit. When applying for these benefits, actions and tasks are triggered in Cúram in the Person record and Application Case. Note: The initial pension or benefit application does not necessarily mean that the client has never applied for a benefit before. The following scenarios outline when a client's application would be considered an initial benefit application, even if it's not their first time applying for a benefit: The client previously applied for benefits but was denied. The client previously applied for benefits but withdrew or cancelled their application. The client was previously auto-enrolled to receive benefits but opted out. The client was an International Operations (IO) client with foreign benefits and is now applying for OAS benefits. Person record A Person record is created when clients apply for any benefit through the client portal. The benefit application then triggers a task in Cúram. You must then validate the following pieces of evidence: Birth and Death Details ; Identification ; and Names . Note: The pieces of evidence mentioned above will only require validation if the SIN/SIR validation process has failed. If the SIN/SIR validation was successful and the information provided in the evidence match, there is no validation required. Some pieces of evidence active in Cúram as soon as clients provide the information in the client portal. The following pieces of evidence do not require any additional action: Addresses ; Contact Preferences ; Gender Details ; Marital Status ; Phone Number; Bank Account ; and Social Insurance Number (SIN) . Note: The SIN evidence will be auto activated in most cases. When the automatic validation fails, Cúram will create a task to indicate that the evidence must be verified under the Tasks tab. You must complete a manual verification of the evidence under the Evidence and Demographics tab. If the client had previously applied for a benefit and the information provided above differs from the previous evidence on file, you must validate and activate the updated pieces of evidence. Clients can upload and submit documents in the client portal to facilitate the verification process or for a reconsideration request. The client portal instructs clients to upload any of the following documents to facilitate the verification process: Government issued ID Evidence of legal status (Citizenship card, PR card, etc.) Birth certificate Marriage certificate Names Baptismal Certificate/Records Citizenship or Immigration Records Marriage Certificate/Records Foreign Documents Affidavit/Declaration Census Church Records Educational Records Employment/Pension Records Private/Personal Records Indian Treaty Status Card Métis Scrip Records Insurance or Government Annuities Medical Records Military Service or Veterans Affairs Public and Vital Statistics Other You can immediately view documents uploaded by clients in Cúram as evidence to be verified on the Person record, under the Evidence and Demographics tab. Application case An Application Case is created in Cúram when clients apply for benefits through the client portal. The following evidence must be verified in the Application Case, if applicable: Retirement or Pension Reduction ; Attestation; Voluntary Tax Withhold ; Application Details ; Marital Relationship; Residence Period ; Consent and Declaration ; Sponsorship ; Foreign Income ; World Income Evidence ; Legal Status ; First Entry Into Canada Details ; Birth and Death Details ; Names ; and SIN verification requirement . Once all information is gathered and verified, you must authorize the Application Case for the benefit application to be approved. If the application is approved, the client is eligible for a benefit and their entitlement is determined. An Integrated Case and Product Delivery Case are created. H2 Exp-coll: Life events information update There are several life events that allow clients to manage their OAS pension and benefits in the client portal. These life events are found in the Profile section under the Tell us if anything has changed section of the Profile page. Clients can update the following life events information in the client portal: Manage Email Addresses Manage Living Apart for Reasons Beyond your Control Manage Marital Relationship Manage My Authorized Person Manage My Income Manage My Payment Destination Manage My Phone Number Manage Voluntary Income Tax Deductions Manage address information Update Communication Preferences Withdraw Old Age Security request For each life event, clients are prompted to provide various types of information. Clients can also upload documents as part of managing their account. Changes that clients make in the client portal is automatically reflected in the Person record, Application Case and/or Integrated Case in Cúram. However, certain evidence, as listed below, will have an "Evidence In Edit" or "Items to Verify" icon next to them to indicate the evidence needs to be validate. Person record Updates made in the client portal will not require any verification to be completed in the Person record. Application case If updates are made to the following evidence in the client portal, a verification task is triggered on the Application Case: Marital Status ; and Living Apart for Reasons Beyond Control . Integrated case The following evidence need to be verified in the Integrated Case, if they have been updated: Marital Status ; and Living Apart for Reasons Beyond Control . Note: Any verification that has been applied on the Integrated Case is also applied on the Application Case automatically. H2 Exp-coll: Request for reconsideration Clients can submit a request for reconsideration through the client portal anytime they disagree with a decision made on their case. When a client submits a request for reconsideration from the client portal, Cúram automatically displays a corresponding reconsideration flag. The reconsideration flag is found on the Context Panel for the Person and/or Prospect person and associated cases for the client. A request for reconsideration task is created in the appropriate work queue. Note: Do not authorize any application when there is an open Reconsideration for the client.

What you need to know Cash Receipts refer to money received in Employment and Social Development Canada to apply towards departmental debts that are managed in Public Sector Collections and Disbursements (PSCD). Normally this money is received either via online banking, cheques or through cross program deductions. Cash receipts are stored under the Financials tab under a person profile or overpayment case in Cúram. When PSCD receives payments to apply against a client's liability, the payment details are sent to Cúram to be stored as a cash receipt. This is the same process involved when PSCD receives cross program liability payments from CPP towards an OAS debt. Cash receipts are generated by the system, and Cúram will record the cash receipt under the user's profile while automatically reducing the outstanding balance of the liability. Additionally, PSCD can send a Cash Receipt Reversal to Cúram to reverse a previously sent cash receipt. Cúram will process this information and add the cash receipt amount back to the outstanding balance of the liability. The cash receipt table displays specific details about the payment. The Method column indicates the source from which the amount was received. The Amount column shows the total payment received. The PSCD Details and Allocations sections are located below the main table. These sections can be expanded by clicking the ( &gt; ) toggle icon next to each section. The Allocations section displays the liability to which the payment was allocated towards, along with the respective dollar amount. Note: When Cúram receives cash receipt details from PSCD, the system automatically processes the information without the need for manual intervention by a worker. This includes both the receipts of payment and allocation processing. Furthermore, you will not have the ability to apply cash receipts or reimburse them in Cúram, these tasks are all managed via PSCD and the interface.

Interest or penalties can be applied to clients, third-party debtors (who have their own account), and non-beneficiary debtors. What you need to know An overpayment case is typically used to rectify a situation where a pension or benefit has been recalculated. In the case of penalties, they are monetary amounts imposed on an individual who has knowingly misrepresented information in relation to CPP or OAS benefits or pensions. The amount of the imposed penalty is determined by the Department, considering factors related to the individual case. Interest is continuously calculated on unpaid penalties and their related overpayments. The Department treats penalties and interest as liabilities that must be repaid by the client. In terms of collecting the money owed for penalties and interest, the Department follows the same procedures as they would for other departmental receivables (e.g. overpayments). There are certain transactions that will result in updates to any penalties and/or interest being made to the Public Sector Collections and Disbursements (PSCD) system. Penalties and Interest: All deductions applied to penalties and interest will be sent to PSCD. Liability deactivation will not transmit to PSCD and will require staff members to manually apply locks to the debt in PSCD to ensure that no further collections occur while it is deactivated. Penalties only Any delete transactions will send PSCD a debt adjustment transaction. Any changes made to the penalty amount not related to remissions, recissions, and write-offs under the Financial Administration Act , will be sent to PSCD as a debt adjustment. Edits related to remissions, recissions and write-offs under the Financial Administration Act will not be transmitted to PSCD as they are expected to originate in PSCD and be transmitted to Cúram. Interest only Any changes made to the interest will not be sent to PSCD and care must be given to ensure that PSCD and Cúram stay in balance. In addition, recovery rates for penalties and interest will be calculated using the maximum deduction amount functionality.

What you need to know Manually entered income evidence records different income types used for calculating a client's GIS , ALW or ALWS benefit amount. It is used to report a client's income during a specific base calendar year attached to a payment period. For example, the manually entered income for the year 2021 applies to the payment period from July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023. The evidence exists in both Integrated Cases and Application Cases. If the benefit is not authorized, the manually entered status evidence is maintained in the Application Case. If the benefit is authorized, the manually entered income evidence is maintained in the Integrated Case. Refer to Application Case, Integrated Case and Product Delivery Case in Cúram (Knowledge) . Note: When manually entering income evidence, Income Deductions are to be calculated ahead of time by the client (as per page 2 of the Statement of Income for the Guaranteed Income Supplement, the Allowance or Allowance for the Survivor for payment period of July (20XX) to June (20XX) with Information Sheet (ISP-3026) form) which means that individual deductions are not captured by Cúram nor would a user do it. Example: the deduction amounts of Block 30800, 22215, and 31200 are entered in the single Net employment income (Block 7), therefore is no way for Cúram to know that this is information was entered and therefore would not be removed afterwards. When manually entering Earnings Exemptions, these are calculated after submitting the manual income evidence. The evidence will always reflect the pre-exemption amount, whereas the income tab of the display rules will reflect the post-exemption amount, which is why Block 7 and Block 8 may be different in the evidence than in the display rules. Cúram will automatically apply the Employment Earnings Exception to client’s income. It is critical that net reported incomes are correctly entered so that Cúram can accurately calculate Earning Exemptions. Cúram will track the client’s retroactive period of date protection when you encode the received date of the manual income evidence. Top tab: Step by Step What you need to do H2 Exp-coll: Add manually entered income evidence In Cúram, go to the client's profile. Refer to Search for a Person in Cúram (Action) .

Note: The Other Canadian pension income field is the only field that can change within a given payment period and is the only field that is affected when an Effective Date of Change is selected. For example, if a client divorces on August 17, 2022, the split pension amount would be removed from the Other Canadian pension income field effective of that date.

What you need to know Legal status evidence captures a client's Canadian legal status. A client may have multiple legal status evidence entries. These entries can contain multiple legal status if there is a change in a client's legal status information. Evidence is listed in descending order from the most recent status. The evidence exists in both Application Cases and Integrated Cases. If the benefit is not approved, the legal status evidence is maintained in the Application Case. If the benefit is approved, the legal status evidence is maintained in the Integrated Case. When the legal status is maintained in the Application Case, adding and editing the evidence require verification. Deleting the legal status in an Application Case does not require any verification or activation. When the legal status evidence is maintained in an Integrated Case, adding and editing the evidence requires verification and activation. Deleting the evidence only requires activation.

What you need to know A manual payment is made outside of Cúram when the system cannot issue a payment for a client, and an immediate payment is required. If the Department issues a payment manually to the client outside of Cúram, the record of the manual payment must be recorded in Cúram through the Manual Payment wizard under the Financials tab at the person level. Once recorded, Cúram compares the gross amount of the manual payment with the system calculated entitlement amount for the coverage period. If a discrepancy exists, Cúram automatically generates an overpayment or underpayment. When deductions exist on the manual payment, Cúram will automatically update the applicable deduction record to reflect the amount withheld from the payment. Not all payments issued outside of Cúram need to be recorded. There will be some exceptions (e.g. refunding deductions to clients). When a client requests a retroactive payment be issued immediately, you can issue the priority payment through the Issue Retro Pending Payments function in the product delivery case.

It also shows all deductions made from these payments, categorized by type. This helps in understanding the net amount received by clients after all deductions. A record is retained for each tax year in which the client receives old age benefits. The data reflects the current information, and the year-to-date totals are updated when you access the page. The following table provides descriptions of the information shown on the Year to Date windows: Table 1—Description of Information Shown in the Current and Previous Year to Date Window Section Description Benefit Issued The Benefit Type column shows the total amounts paid to the client by type (OAS, GIS , ALW and ALWS ).

What you need to know H2 Exp-coll: Write-offs Updated New There are 2 different types of write-offs: write-offs under the Financial Administration Act ; and write-offs in Cúram. New A write-off under the Financial Administration Act is the removal of an overpayment, in whole or in part, from the accounts receivable records. Depending on the write-off reason, it may be a permanent or temporary forgiveness of the debt. For more information, refer to Write-Off an Overpayment (Scenario) . Updated However, a write-off in Cúram is an adjustment that reduces the initial liability amount of a debt. It is not an actual forgiveness of the debt, and it could be recovered at some point in the future. H2 Exp-coll: Remissions Updated Updated A remission is the decision to forgive an otherwise legally enforceable debt and is managed through the write-off functionality in Cúram. Remissions should only be used when it is determined that none of the liability will be recovered in the future. Updated Note: Recommendations for full remissions must be requested directly in the Public Sector Collections and Disbursements system. You must submit a CFOB F&amp;A Portal External link request for partial remissions only. You should never input a remission or write-off under the Financial Administration Act directly in Cúram unless there is an interface failure and you are directed to do so by the Chief Financial Officer Branch. H2 Exp-coll: Reversals of write-offs or remissions Reversals of remissions or write-offs under the Financial Administration Act are only done in Cúram in exceptional cases when the Public Sector Collections and Disbursements system interface is unable to transmit or receive data. When you reverse a write-off or remission, the initial liability amount or outstanding debt balance is increased by the amount of the reversal in the Person record. As a result, the debt becomes collectible again. The write-off may or may not be able to be reversed in the future depending on the write-off reason. For example, a compromise settlement or a discharged bankruptcy cannot be reversed. H2 Exp-coll: Write-off reason codes New Note: When a cancellation request is submitted, Cúram calculates any resulting overpayments based on the gross amount paid. To ensure accurate recovery, the appropriate write-off reason codes must be applied in Cúram to adjust the amounts accordingly. The following write-off reason codes are available in Cúram: Table 1. Write-off reason codes and description Write-off reason code Description Cancelled Legacy Payment This code is used in situations when updated evidence created an overpayment based on previously migrated data, and a cancelled legacy payment exists for the same period; the amount of the cancelled legacy payment can then be applied towards the client's debt. This will trigger a debt adjustment in the Public Sector Collections and Disbursements (PSCD) system making it possible to collect the actual recoverable amount. Benefit Cancellation Deductions This code is used to write-off a portion of the overpayment when there are deductions (e.g. voluntary tax, OAS recovery tax) associated with a benefit cancellation. This ensures that the overpayment balance in PSCD accurately reflects the client’s actual liability that should be recovered. When a client does not repay all amounts received within the prescribed timeframe and the benefit cancellation request cannot be approved, you will reverse the write-off and a corresponding Benefit Cancellation Deductions reversal reason is created. Reconciliation – RD This code is used when a client receives a payment that includes a reversible deduction (e.g. non-resident tax, federal voluntary tax, OAS recovery tax deducted in the current year), and a subsequent reassessment for that period results in an entitlement of $0. In these cases, you must manually reverse the deduction and use this write-off reason to reduce the total overpayment amount for the client. For more information, refer to Manual Reversal of Deduction in Cúram (Action) . This will ensure that PSCD will have the correct overpayment amount, if any, resulting from the reconciliation of reversible deductions and ensures corporate accounting will have the correct information to adjust their interdepartmental settlements for the month and year. This write-off reason is reversible in Cúram. If a debt adjustment is reversed, the trigger will automatically increase the liability in PSCD. Reconciliation – NRD This code is used to write-off non-reversible deduction overpayments that were created as part of the payment cancellation process. This code is not tracked by PSCD, but it is tracked by corporate accounting for balancing departmental funds. Non-reversible deductions include: department of justice arrears and fees; provincial voluntary tax withholds; CRA set-off; and taxes deducted in the previous year (non-resident tax, federal voluntary tax and OAS recovery tax). Other This code is used to partially or fully write-off an overpayment amount when the other codes do not fit the situation or when directed to through enquiries or guidance. An event is triggered for the PSCD to reduce the liability amount. The write-off can be reversed, which will increase the liability amount in PSCD. Top tab: Step by Step What you need to do H2 Exp-coll: Manually create a write-off or remission for an overpayment Updated New Warning: You must manually create a write-off for an overpayment in exceptional circumstances only.

What you need to know An OAS / GIS Application Case is automatically created once an OAS and GIS application form is added in Cúram. Refer to Add an OAS and GIS Application Form in Cúram (Action) . An OAS / GIS Application Case can be accessed from the person's profile. You can view the OAS / GIS application for more information associated with a client's Application before starting the authorizing process. New If a client's OAS application was approved before the cutover (i.e. before March 1, 2025) but their GIS application was not, you must submit a standalone “Application for Guaranteed Income Supplement” to authorize the GIS . However, if you submit a new “Application for Old Age Security Pension and Guaranteed Income Supplement” instead, you must proceed with completing all necessary case work in the Application Case, including adding evidences, completing verifications, and resolving any outstanding tasks. The OAS benefit should then be authorized. Cúram will copy the relevant evidence to the migrated Integrated Case. You must then review the Integrated Case to ensure all evidence has been carried over to the Integrated Case and determine whether any overrides need to the updated or removed based on the information available. You can now authorize the GIS . New Note: Authorizing the OAS pension will not generate a duplicate benefit, as Cúram maintains only one Integrated Case and one Product Delivery Case. Note: The OAS/ GIS Application Case initial status is Open , or Awaiting Resolution . After you click Approve or Close the OAS/ GIS Application, the status is changed to Closed . Note: If Close is selected, the Application Case status becomes Closed . In this situation, an Integrated Case is not created. You must manually create a correspondence letter to inform the client of the decision. Refer to Correspondence—Create, Update, and Check Status in Cúram (Action) . After the OAS pension has been authorized, the Benefits page refreshes automatically and updates the status of the Benefit from Pending to Approved , and Completed On date is populated. The application case status is changed to Closed. Before authorizing your application case you can click Check Eligibility, Cúram runs eligibility checks and updates the eligibility decision on the eligibility check screen. You can view the details of the unmet criteria (e.g. residency, age) on the potential eligibility screen. If any evidence is missing or requires verification, you must manually send the correspondence associated with the tasks based on the information required to process the application. Once all the verifications and issues or flags have been resolved, an application can be authorized. When you select Authorize , a potential eligibility check record is created on the application case. Note: All open tasks other than the Application Case task must be closed before authorization. Failure to close tasks may potentially prevent the authorization of the Application Case. Viewing details of decisions The following screens can be used to view details of decisions for each criterion: Approved: Approval tab on Benefit line item can be expanded to view the criteria assessed. Closure: Closure tab on Benefit line item can be expanded to view the criteria assessed. Evidence: If an evidence issue exists, you can navigate to the evidence issue screen and view all the evidence which have an issue. Each individual evidence can be accessed to learn more about the issues. All client registered: If this criterion is not met, the user can check all the applicants on the application case to confirm which user is not registered. Identity confirmed: If this criterion is not met, the user can validate if there is outstanding verification on Name and SIN evidence. If there is a duplicate application during the authorization, the user will have to close one of them before authorizing the other. If the client is already receiving benefits, you will need to manually close the duplicate application. After the benefit has been authorized, the Old Age Security Integrated Case and Product Delivery Case are created. The Integrated Case will also be used for the GIS . If the client already has an Integrated Case or a Product Delivery Case, the cases will be updated with any new evidence information. Clients can receive OAS and GIS benefits together. However, they cannot receive ALW / ALWS Benefits along with OAS/ GIS . In some cases, an application may be added in Cúram and later denied. You must deny these applications in Cúram and the associated task should be closed. You can manually reopen a closed or withdrawn OAS or GIS benefit on the OAS GIS combined application case. This is possible when an Administrative Error , Appeal Decision , Request for Reconsideration, and/or a Response Received from SSA Country reopening reasons are met. Spouse and Non-Pensioner Spouse Non-Pensioner spouses are required to be registered as a Person to authorize GIS Benefit. Relevant tasks must be resolved. If there is a non-pensioner spouse on the application case, the benefit still needs to be authorized to close the application case. However, since the spouse is a non-pensioner, they will not be eligible for GIS . When an application is submitted with a spouse, you will need to deny their GIS benefit. If a spouse’s address differs from the primary applicant’s address, the provided address must be reviewed to ensure it matches the one listed on the application. In cases where the system has not automatically updated the spouse’s address, a manual update must be performed to reflect the correct address. GIS When a client qualifies for GIS , a single Old Age Security Benefit case is created and maintained to handle renewals on an annual basis. If the income is missing, it can be manually added. Active Application Details evidence with GIS must exist for the client before performing an override. If there are two applicants on a GIS application, both applicants must have Application Details evidence recorded. Failure to capture Application Details for both applicants will prevent the system from proceeding with GIS authorization. Marital Relationship The full period of the marital relationship must be provided to determine entitlement for income tested benefits. When a spouse’s date of death is added, the application case is automatically updated with this information, along with the marital status. If there is period of entitlement when the spouse was alive then you will add the spouse and their income to the application case. It is still possible to confirm a client’s marital status without requiring a date of marriage. You can contact the client to obtain the start date of the marriage. Ideally, the start date of the marriage should align with the start date of the benefit. If the marriage start date is provided within the same month as the benefit effective date, the benefit calculation can include the marital status from the benefit start date. When a person’s marital status is not aligned with the system’s record, Cúram will prevent the application from being processed. Marital status at the Person level cannot be updated directly. Instead, users must navigate to the application case and update the marital relationship evidence. Once the marital relationship evidence is activated, the marital status at the Person level will automatically update. Eligibility and Future Effective Date An application may have a future effective date, which can be found on the Client’s Application Case or their Integrated Case. The future effective date is located within the Application Details evidence under the Evidence tab. If all required criteria are met, a benefit can be authorized with a future effective date. On the eligibility check records, the user can view a detailed summary of all the criteria assessed to determine eligibility. Ensure correct application date is entered to ensure eligibility is properly calculated. The initial period of eligibility is determined based on the date of application, not the processing date. Eligibility for benefits is assessed from when the application was submitted. For Clients where earliest date of eligibility is more than 11 months after the application receipt date (For example, a 63-year-old Client submitting an OAS application), a user may add the "Initial Eligibility Period" Override to the case prior to authorization. This will not result in the Client meeting the Eligibility &amp; Entitlement criteria earlier than under normal circumstances, but will allow for the application to be approved even if the calculated earliest date of eligibility is beyond the 11 months following the receipt date of the application. The initial eligibility period override does not extend the retroactive period for applications submitted after the earliest date of eligibility. The system will calculate retroactive benefits, including underpayments, automatically. When a client requests a retroactive payment or underpayment be issued immediately, you can issue the priority payment through the Issue Retro Pending Payments function in the product delivery case. Refer to Manual Payment and Priority Payment—Record and Issue in Cúram (Action) Documents During a triage task, the processor may be unsure about where to move the document. A document should be reviewed to determine where it should be moved to by the processing agent. If the document is related to or in support of an application, then it should be moved to the Application Case. If the document is about the individual and not specific to a benefit, then it can reside at the person level. The user needs to determine why the document was provided and then move it to the appropriate location to action. There will be cases that a document has to go to the Person (e.g. paper application received and there is no Application Case) and then the document can be moved afterwards if required. A document received for a verification cannot be moved from a Task directly to the verification. Documents for verifications must be moved to the location where the verification exists (e.g. Person) and then can be moved to the verification. This process applies to all document types, as there are no rules that prevent a user from moving a document type to a Case or a Person.

What you need to know Voluntary Tax Withhold (VTW) evidence captures the details of the monthly federal and/or provincial tax amount a client requested to have withheld from their OAS benefits. A client can request VTW using the Request for Voluntary Federal Income Tax Deductions CPP and OAS (ISP-3520) or section D3 Taxes of the Old Age Security and Guaranteed Income Supplement (ISP-3550) forms, or through their My Service Canada account. The evidence exists in both Integrated Cases and Application Cases. If the benefit is not authorized, the VTW evidence is maintained in the Application Case. If the benefit is authorized, the VTW evidence is maintained in the Integrated Case. VTW evidence can be added for a client at the Application Case level or Integrated Case level when their application is processed and after their case is active. Note: The provincial tax withholding type only applies to residents of Quebec. Quebec's provincial tax withholding is not applied until the 7th month after the date the first payment was issued. If VTW evidence needs to be updated (i.e. if the VTW evidence was 10% and is increased to 15%), the End Date should be entered for the existing VTW evidence and a new VTW evidence should be created with the new deduction value. This allows for traceability of evidence that were used in gross to net calculations. There are several cases in which a user would edit an existing voluntary tax withhold evidence: To correct incorrectly added information To update a client’s percentage or dollar amount based on a client’s request To stop the voluntary tax withhold based on a client’s request Note: If a user attempts to change the Start Date or End Date of a voluntary tax withhold evidence that has already been used in the gross to net payment calculation or gross to net processing period, the system will not allow the change and provide you with an error message. The cover period on a payment (i.e, transaction) provides the date range in which the voluntary tax withhold evidence was used. The earliest End Date that can be entered is the day after the cover period.

What you need to know An ALW / ALWS application case is created when a new application for ALW and/or ALWS benefits is submitted in Cúram. An ALW / ALWS Application Case can be accessed from the person's profile. If a prospect person record exists due to the client information being received from a restricted country, you must register the Prospect Person as a Person before you proceed to authorize the ALW / ALWS benefit. Refer to Register a Prospect Person as a Person in Cúram (Action) . Cúram will determine the earliest eligibility date based on the eligibility criteria according to the information entered. All evidence must be active before authorizing an Application Case. This is to ensure the current eligibility determination is made regardless of the actual outcome. If there is a duplicate application with Open status, you must close one before you authorize the benefit. If an application is closed by mistake, you can also reopen the application manually. You will manually send the correspondence associated with the tasks based on the information required to process the application. When you select Authorize , a potential eligibility check record is created on the application case. On the eligibility check records, the user can view a detailed summary of all the criteria assessed to determine eligibility. The following screens can be used to view details of decisions for each criterion: Table 1—Decision and Detail for Each Criterion Decision Detail Approved The Approval tab on the Benefit line item can be expanded to view the criteria assessed. Closure The Closure tab on the Benefit line item can be expanded to view the criteria assessed. Evidence If an evidence issue exists, you can navigate to the evidence issue screen and view all the evidence which have an issue. Each individual evidence can be accessed to learn more about the issues. The details of the unmet criteria can be viewed by the client on the potential eligibility screen. This will confirm if there is any outstanding verification on the evidence. You can manually reopen a closed or withdrawn ALW / ALWS benefit on the Application Case. This is possible when an Administrative Error , Appeal Decision , Request for Reconsideration, and/or a Response Received from SSA Country reopening reasons are met. Consent required from spouse on ALW / ALWS cases Applications for OAS program benefits cannot be approved without a valid consent to the terms of the application and declaration of the truth of the information provided by all parties to the application. The Consent and Declaration evidence type captures this data for each participant on an Application Case. If the Application submitted for a client does not include the Consent for a participant, Cùram will generate a task stating that the Consent is required. This can be viewed from the Tasks tab on the application case. You must add the Consent and Declaration evidence and close this task prior to Authorization. If the task is not Closed, system will prevent the Authorization of the Application Case. Steps to follow when the ALW / ALWS is not showing up for a retroactive period The retroactive information is automatically calculated by Cùram. If an ALWS client was ineligible for the retroactive period, a separate application for ALW is not required. You can review the display rules for the retroactive period, to determine why the client is not eligible or not entitled. Note: Display rules can be accessed from the Determinations tab on the Product Delivery Case. You can select the coverage period for which they would like to view the determination by choosing the appropriate link. Guidance for processing ALW / ALWS applications if received simultaneously When processing ALW and ALWS applications received simultaneously, the following conditions should be verified: Was the client married on the Application Date ? If yes, an application for ALW must be added. Was the client a Surviving Spouse on the Application Date ? If yes, an application for ALWS must be added. If the conditions above are not met, there is no further processing required. Processing an ALWS application when there is a migrated OAS/ GIS application, but no spouse If you are processing an application for ALWS , but there is no spousal information, you can add an ALWS application for the client without the spousal information stating that the client is a Surviving Spouse.

What you need to know Residence Period evidence captures a client's periods of residence in and outside of Canada since the age of 18. Only periods in Canada or periods deemed to have been in Canada, contribute to the entitlement determination. Periods in Canada as well as those in countries with whom Canada has a Social Security Agreement may be considered for the purposes of eligibility. A client may report a change in their current residence and, if they are no longer in Canada, they report the reason for the absence and whether they intend to return to the country. Note: A client may have multiple periods of residence if they resided outside of Canada (e.g. if they have employment outside of Canada). There must be one Residence Period evidence entry for each residence period. Note: Residence periods are also automatically added as part of the application intake process. An ESDC employee will be assigned a task to confirm each individual's type of Canadian residence (absence and/or deemed residence). The evidence exists in both Integrated Cases and Application Cases. If the benefit is not approved, the residence period evidence is maintained in the Application Case. If the benefit is approved, the residence period evidence is maintained in the Integrated Case. Refer to Application Case, Integrated Case and Product Delivery Case in Cùram (Knowledge) . In an Application Case, the evidence will be considered during the eligibility check and/or authorization process. Once the evidence is activated in the Integrated Case, it will trigger the Eligibility &amp; Entitlement rules and recalculation. Cúram will calculate residence for the purposes of Eligibility &amp; Entitlement consideration within the system.

What you need to know Cúram uses different case types to reflect different business needs across the lifecycle for the delivery of OAS benefits. The fundamental case types include: Application Case Integrated Case Product Delivery Case H2 Exp-coll: Application Case An Application Case is created when the client applies for an OAS pension and/or OAS benefits (i.e. GIS and ALW and ALWS benefits) by submitting the application form either via paper or the client portal in Cúram. You can find an Application Case by clicking Applications on the page group navigation bar under the Cases and Applications tab of the Person profile. There are 2 types of Application Cases: OAS/ GIS Application Case ALW / ALWS Application Case It is important to accurately record all details provided by the client as appropriate evidences, prior to authorizing an Application Case. You can verify the client's potential eligibility using the Check Eligibility function prior to authorization. When you initiate the authorization process, Cúram conducts an eligibility check as the first step. An Application Case can be authorized once all information is gathered. If the authorization is approved and successful, the client is eligible for a benefit and will have their entitlement determined. A correspondence letter will be sent out automatically through Cúram to inform the client. If the required information is not received, the application case must be closed and could result in the client not being eligible for or entitled to benefits. A correspondence letter will be sent out automatically through Cúram to inform the client of the decision as well. You can manually reopen a closed or withdrawn Application Case when the situation allows. For example, if the client requests reconsideration of a decision, and the Department changes the decision after processing the reconsideration or if the Department receives the agreement information from another country. Both the OAS pension and GIS applications can exist in one Application Case. If that is the case, Cúram requires separate authorization for each benefit. Note: The OAS pension must be authorized and approved first to authorize and approve the GIS benefit. After the benefit authorization results in Approval, Cúram automatically creates the Integrated Case and Product Delivery Case to manage and deliver the benefit. If the Application Case has 2 benefits, Cúram still creates one Integrated Case and one Product Delivery Case after the first benefit is authorized and approved. Each Application Case contains the following tabs: Table 1—Tab Name and Detail in an Application Case Tab Name Detail Home The Home tab consists of: Home Urgent Flags The Home page provides a summary of the benefits, outstanding verifications and transaction history. The Urgent Flags page lists current and previous urgent flags assigned to the Application Case. If any enquiries under MP Enquiry, Ministerial Enquiry or Dire Needs are raised under the Contacts tab, the urgent flags will display here. Benefits The Benefits tab displays the benefits the client applied for. The list may include the: OAS Pension GIS Benefit ALW / ALWS Benefit Task The Tasks tab displays the tasks related to the Application Case. Contacts The Contacts tab consists of: Communications Attachments The Communications page contains recorded enquiries and letters sent to the clients related to the Application Case. The Attachments page contains all the links to the documentation stored in the Pension Trusted Digital Repository (e.g. application, supporting documents) associated with the Application Case. Evidence The Evidence tab stores case-specific evidence information. It consists of the following pages: Dashboard Evidence Issues Verifications Incoming Evidence The Dashboard page lists all the evidence that can be stored in the Application Case. When evidence is added or edited, Cúram determines if the new or updated evidence requires verification. If any evidence type requires attention for verification or issues, an icon will display next to the evidence name. The context panel also includes a summary of evidence verification and issues. If the evidence name is blue, it means the evidence has existing data. You can click the name of the evidence to view the details. The Evidence page lists all the active evidence related to the Application Case. An evidence will only be active when no verification or issue is present. The Issues page lists system-identified evidence issues in the Application Case that require attention. Issues are listed when Cúram detects an evidence is missing key information (e.g. marital relationship with incomplete data). The Verifications page lists all the evidence that require manual verification (e.g. adding proof to prove a client's legal status). The Incoming Evidence page displays common evidence that have been shared from other cases (e.g. an updated marital status). The incoming evidence will be displayed on this page, until it is updated or disregarded. Interfaces The Interfaces tab displays: Requests sent to the CRA; and/or Any income information received from the CRA. The types of requests include: Add to CRA Lifetime List Delete from CRA Lifetime List Income Inquiry Participants The Participants tab displays the information of all related clients and/or their spouses under the Application Case. It consists of: Current Participants Previous Participants The Participants page will only display if more than one participant is associated with the Application Case. The Current Participants page lists all case participants currently related to the Application Case. The Previous Participants page lists all the participants that are removed from the Current Participants page before the Application Case is authorized and the benefit was approved. Potential Eligibility The Potential Eligibility tab provides a preview of the eligibility results for benefits in the Application Case based on the available evidence at the time when you use the Check Eligibility functionality. To view the eligibility of each period, click Check Eligibility and a decision table will appear under the Eligibility Checks section title. The information displayed is based on the data currently available in Cúram. The types of decisions include: Eligible Not Eligible Related Cases The Related Cases tab displays the cases linked to the Application Case. The types of related cases include: Old Age Security (Integrated Case) Old Age Security Program Benefits (Product Delivery Case) Administration The Administration tab displays the transaction history and the case owner of the Application Case. It consists of the following pages: Transaction History User Roles The Transaction History page documents all the detailed actions that were taken on the Application Case.

What you need to know An overpayment case is used to make a correction to a benefit when it has been recalculated. When an overpayment deduction is added, the client is given a 60-day notice period to respond. There are 2 types of overpayment cases: a Department employee manually creates an overpayment case; and payment correction cases created by Cúram when a recalculation is completed on previously paid benefits. Note: You can identify an Overpayment (Manual) and a Payment Correction case by the record name. Each have the case type followed by a reference number and name (e.g. Overpayment (Manual) 2000003094 – James Stone or Payment Correction – 1111111111 – James Stone). You can view manual overpayment information by navigating to the Transactions tab under the Financials tab on the Person level or the Transactions tab under the Financial tab on the Benefit Overpayment case. The following information is available: Transaction information (e.g. the type of overpayment, payee, method, processed date, status, due date and amount of the overpayment); Note: The projected end date for the recovery deduction is based on the maximum deduction amount. Status information; Deduction information; Note: The deduction percentage is 0.01% and the amount is $0.00 until the financial batches are run and they are automatically calculated.

What you need to know Recipients of an OAS pension or GIS can request the cancellation of these entitlements within the first 6 months of payment. When a request of cancellation is granted, all issued payments must be repaid. The pension or benefit may be cancelled provided the beneficiary repays all amounts received no later than 6 months after the day on which their request for a cancellation is granted. Note: When a request for cancellation is granted, you must create a task to verify the repayment status after 6 months. The purpose of this work item is to determine whether repayment has been made or if the benefit should be reinstated. If the client does not repay all amounts within 6 months, the benefit cancellation status must be changed to Delinquent . This will reinstate the benefits. When the Benefit Cancellation Request Status of the entitlement is changed to Repaid , and the change is applied, the Application Status is set to Cancelled . The Benefit Cancellation Request Evidence is applied to the OAS application case and the GIS application case will also be cancelled. The corresponding overpayment will be sent to PSCD once activated but will have a 10 month collection deferral date so the debt will not be sent to the CRA for collection.

What you need to know You can add evidence, correct errors and update information on a client's profile record, as necessary. Once the client is registered, Cúram adds the submitted evidence to the Dashboard page and the Active Evidence page of the Evidence tab on the profile record. Refer to Register a Person in Cúram (Action) . Note: Depending on the evidence type, you may have to verify and/or activate the evidence so that it is available for use by Cúram. Whenever you are activating evidences, ensure that your changes were applied by checking the Active Evidence tab and the Dashboard tab. The following client's person record evidence is accessed on the Dashboard : Addresses Foreign Bank Details Names Bank Accounts Gender Details Office Of Control Consent to Deduction and Payment Identification Phone Number Contact Preferences (Preferred Language of Oral Communication and Preferred Language of Written) Last Province at Time of Application Third Party Contact Email Addresses Marital status Note: Birth and death details evidence is only available on the Active Evidence page. Note: Updating the marital status in one case automatically updates the status in the spouse's case. The steps for managing the following evidence types are described in the references listed below: Table 1—Existing References for Evidence Types Evidence References Names Change Identification Information (SIN, Names, Date of Birth) in Cúram (Action) SIN Change Identification Information (SIN, Names, Date of Birth) in Cúram (Action) Addresses Addresses—View, Edit, Add, Delete and Capture in Cúram (Action) Birth Change Identification Information (SIN, Names, Date of Birth) in Cúram (Action) Death Death Details Evidence — Edit in Cúram (Action) Consent to deduction and payment Consent to Deduction and Payment Evidence—Add, Edit, View and Delete in Cúram (Action) Third Party Contact Third Party Contacts—Add, View, Edit, and Delete in Cúram (Action) Contact preferences The contact preference evidence is where the preferred language or oral communication, preferred language of written communication, and the preferred method of correspondence (including tax slips) can be updated. Verification items for Birth and Death Details evidence Cúram accepts a variety of items to be used as proof to verify the Birth and Death Details evidence. The acceptable items for Date of Birth are listed below: Birth Certificate Baptismal Certificate/Records Citizenship or Immigration Records Marriage Certificate/Records Foreign Documents Affidavit/Declaration Census Church Records Educational Records Employment/Pension Records Private/Personal Records Indian Treaty Status Card Métis Script Records Insurance or Government Annuities Medical Records Military Service or Veterans Affairs Public and Vital Statistics Other Restricted Liaison Liaison Cúram accepts a variety of items to be used as proof for Birth and Death Details evidence. The acceptable items for Date of Death are listed below: Registration of Death Death Certificate Religious Proof of Death Medical Proof of Death SSA Proof of Death Federal Proof of Death Provincial Proof of Death Other The 2 Birth and Death Details verifications may appear as outstanding verifications and are not duplicate actions. One verification is used to verify the Date of Birth details, and the second verification is used to verify the Date of Death details. Note: Document status can be edited by clicking Edit on the verification attachment. The document status is required for verification. Bank Account Information Updated When you receive new banking information for a client, it should be entered as a new bank account on the Person Evidence Case. There are only 2 cases where a user should use the Edit function on a Bank Account Evidence: To correct incorrect information previously entered, and no payments have been made to that account. The client has communicated that the bank account has been permanently closed, and the Account Status can be updated to Closed . The Account Name must be entered as or changed to alphabetical characters that reflect the client’s name. You must use the following formatting for the Account Name field for individual accounts: Use the first letter of the client’s first name, followed by a space and their full last name. Example A Smith Note: Do not enter a period after the first letter of the client’s first name and ensure there is a space between the first initial and the last name. If a middle name is provided, it can be abbreviated to an initial and placed between the first initial and the last name, separated by spaces. Example A J Smith The Account Name field in Cúram has a character limit of 60. However, when sharing the new direct deposit information with CPP, the Account Name entered in Cúram must be limited to 30 characters to comply with Account Holder name input requirements for ITRDS . For individual accounts exceeding this limit only , you must follow the instructions below: In Cúram: Update the direct deposit information for OAS, ensuring the above account name formatting is followed. Do not check the Use for CPP checkbox. In ITRDS , provide detailed notes indicating that due to character limits, the direct deposit was only updated in Cúram. Fill out the Communication between programs (ISP-0435) form, noting that the direct deposit information has been updated for OAS and requires review by CPP. Refer to Communication Between Programs (ISP-0435) Form (Action) . If a user receives any validation message regarding missing, cancelled, closed, or duplicated bank branches when attempting to add a new bank account evidence, then you must send a ticket to the National Service Desk Internal link . Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) receives data from Canadian financial institutions regarding changes to a client’s direct deposit information. Once PSPC verifies the Standard Payment System and performs updates, they create a Notice of Change File which is sent to the Department. When the Notice of Change is received from PSPC to update direct deposit information, Cúram attempts to automatically update it for clients. If Cúram is unable to automatically update the direct deposit information based on the Notice of Change, a task will be generated. You must review the client's information and manually add the direct deposit information. This will ensure that payment goes to the correct bank account. Direct Deposit Link Updated After the new bank account is added and applied, the account must be linked to the OAS program using the Direct Deposit Link functionality under the Financials tab on the Person Evidence Case, starting with the correct date (either current or future). This linking step ensures that the new bank account information is applied to the Product Delivery Case automatically. There are only two cases where a user should use the Edit function on a Direct Deposit Link: To correct information that has been entered incorrectly. To end-date the direct deposit link, as the client is switching to receive payment by cheque. If a client reports new banking information, you must add a new direct deposit link. This will end-date the previous direct deposit link automatically. New direct deposit information for all clients must be recorded as a Joint Account and the Account Name must be entered as or changed to alphabetical characters that reflect the clients' name. For more information, refer to Managing Bank Account Evidence for Joint Bank Accounts in Cúram (Action) . New If the client indicated that they want their direct deposit to start in the future and you enter that date in the Start Date field, the system will automatically update the Product Delivery Case when the future date arrives. If direct deposit information has been received for a client that is not yet an OAS client (e.g. they are too young), there will be no person record in Cúram. You must add a note in ITRDS that the client has never applied for OAS and send the OAS, Direct Deposit, Form incorrect or incomplete, ask client to complete form (ISS-8584) letter to the client. You do not need to create a Prospect Person. The direct deposit correspondence that was received can be shredded. Foreign Bank Details Information Below are the different processes to follow depending on the method that the department receives a foreign bank details request. H2 Exp-coll: Client Portal application Foreign Bank Details evidence is automatically created on a client's account, and a task is automatically generated when a client submits a new application with foreign bank details via the Client Portal. You must review the client's application and complete processing activities but do not authorize the benefit. If the client is eligible and entitled for a benefit, you must forward the outstanding foreign bank details task to the Foreign Direct Deposit unit's work queue (i.e. OAS-Foreign-Direct-Deposit ) and update ITRDS notes. The Foreign Direct Deposit unit must then process the foreign bank details in the Standard Payment System, update ITRDS notes and forward the task back to the OAS processing officer who has the client's application case task assigned to them. This information can be found on the client's case Tasks page. If there is no OAS processing officer with the application case task reserved, then the Foreign Direct Deposit unit must assign it to the appropriate regional processing work queue based on the client's Office of Control. H2 Exp-coll: Paper application In the rare case that a client submits foreign direct deposit information with their paper application, you must select Cheque in the Payment Destination section of the Applicant Details wizard when adding the application to Cúram . Complete all processing activities, including authorizing the benefit. If the client is eligible and entitled for a benefit, you must: Create a new manual task as follows: Table 2.

Category Select OAS Maintenance . Type Select Foreign Direct Deposit . Priority Select Medium . Due Date Select a date 30 days from current date.

Generic bank account details Field Value Branch Transit Number 00082 Financial Institution Number 260 Account Number 999999999999 Add a corresponding Direct Deposit Link . Complete the task, if applicable. Update ITRDS notes. H2 Exp-coll: Foreign direct deposit request At intake, support clerks will triage foreign direct deposit requests and set the Document Type to Foreign Direct Deposit .

The Foreign Direct Deposit unit must add the foreign bank details in Standard Payment System and in Cúram on the Person record: Add the Foreign Bank Details Add or update the Bank Accounts evidence using the generic bank account details as follows: Table 4.

Complete the task, if applicable. Update ITRDS notes. Evidence exception When there is an evidence exception on the person profile, it is due to information provided during the application process causing a conflict in the system. It will be displayed on the Tasks Type. The Type will display Evidence Exception(s) . This can be viewed from the Tasks tab on the Person profile or on the Type field on the task. Note: The evidence exception is only displayed on the person profile and will not appear on the case.

What you need to know There are 2 types of tax slips that can be viewed in Cúram: The T4A (OAS) is generated for clients who received any payment in Canada or deemed residents. It is used for reporting OAS pension income. It shows the amount of OAS pension received during the year. The NR4 (OAS) is generated for clients who received any OAS pension payment outside of Canada. It reports amounts paid or credited to non-residents of Canada, including pensions, annuities and other income. It indicates the type of income paid, the total amount, and the amount of Canadian tax withheld. It is used to assist in claiming a refund for overpaid taxes or in paying additional taxes owed.

What you need to know Marital status evidence Marital Status evidence exists at the person level and captures a client's legal marital status. This evidence is not used by Eligibility and Entitlement rules. For the purposes of OAS, Marital Relationship evidence, which tracks an actual link to another participant, is used. Marital status on the Person is automatically updated based on marital relationship evidence created and activated on the application case or integrated case. Changes to the marital status must be performed by updating the marital relationship evidence once it exists Marital relationship evidence Marital Relationship evidence on an OAS/ GIS Application case or Integrated case records the relationship details such as the relationship status, duration, and related participant. The start date identifies when a relationship starts, and the effective date of change is used to indicate the date that a relationship status changes. Updates to Marital Relationship evidence are used to update the person-level Marital Status evidence. When this evidence is activated with no outstanding verifications or evidence issues, the primary participant's Marital Status evidence is automatically updated to match the Marital Relationship evidence for both participants. Example: James Smith's Marital Status evidence was Single when his person profile was created in Cúram. On the Application Case, the Marital Relationship evidence was updated indicating that he was Married. The Marital Status evidence on James' person profile will update automatically to Married. This will also be reflected on James' partners' person profile. Living apart for reasons beyond control evidence Living apart for reasons beyond control evidence captures the reason why a client and their spouse are living apart when this living arrangement is beyond their control. A client can have multiple periods of living apart for reasons beyond control during a marital relationship resulting in multiple evidence records. Each living apart for reasons beyond control evidence can have a single related consent to be disadvantaged evidence. When a couple is living apart for reasons beyond control, if it is to the overall advantage of the couple but to the disadvantage of one member to be paid using Rate Table 1, the client who is disadvantaged must give consent to receive a lower entitlement amount. Marital relationship, living apart for reasons beyond control and consent to be disadvantaged evidence records are used to determine the financial household for income-tested benefits. It is important that these 3 evidences are added in this order. Note: If a client has multiple periods of living apart for reasons beyond control in the same marital relationship, they must give consent for each period. A client can change their consent during a period when they are living apart for a reason beyond their control. The evidence exists in both Application Cases and Integrated Cases. If the OAS benefit is not approved, the marital relationship, living apart for reasons beyond control and consent to be disadvantaged evidence is maintained in the Application Case. If the benefit is authorized and approved, the marital relationship, living apart for reasons beyond control and consent to be disadvantaged evidence is maintained in the Integrated Case. Migrated accounts New For migrated accounts, the marital relationship start date is set to the month before the 1st month of entitlement in Cúram. This has 2 implications: For any retroactive marital relationship changes before the implementation of Cúram, the marital relationship evidence must be updated to the actual start date of the relationship, so that the subsequent change can be accurately captured. This includes adding periods where the client and their spouse or common-law partner are living apart for reasons beyond control, or periods where one spouse or common-law partner gives consent to receive a lower entitlement amount for periods living apart for reasons beyond control. Income is shared across spousal cases for periods where the client is in an active relationship. If there are any income evidences that need to be shared to the case of the spouse or common-law partner, the marital relationship must be updated to indicate that there was an active relationship during the period for which income must be shared.

What you need to know Cúram creates an underpayment when it determines that a client was paid less for a past period than they were entitled to. Cúram reassesses entitlement to each OAS pension or benefit when new evidence is added, or when existing evidence is updated and activated. When Cúram reassesses a client's entitlement and a new entitlement is determined for a past period, the system compares this new entitlement to the past issued entitlement amount to determine if an underpayment exists. If the new amount is higher than the previously issued amount, the individual is determined to have been underpaid and Cúram automatically creates a Payment Correction – Underpaid case. This case can be found under the Cases and Applications tab. Updated Payments that would have been due to the client had they been enrolled in a program before their actual date of enrollment are not processed as underpayments in Cúram. If a client is determined to be eligible for a pension or benefit for a past period when no payment was issued, the payments that the client would have been eligible for will be processed as arrears rather than as underpayments. An arrears payment is a retroactive payment that has not previously been assessed. Note: After adding or modifying evidence on an Integrated Case and before activating the change, you must run an eligibility check to avoid unnecessary underpayment cases from being created. Refer to Eligibility and Entitlement Override Evidence—Add, Edit, View, and Delete in Cúram (Action) . Each OAS pension or benefit for the client is assessed separately. If a client receives multiple OAS benefits and Cúram determines that more than one of those benefits were underpaid in the same period, a separate Correction – Underpaid case is created for each benefit. Each specific period in which it has been determined that the client has been underpaid is recorded as a separate transaction. By default, the sum of all underpayments will be resolved at the time the client is next scheduled to receive a payment. The issuance of an underpayment can be modified manually in Cúram. When assessing what to modify the underpayment issuance to, the Department's representative must review the Operational Payment Production Schedule to determine when they want the client to receive the payment by. Once the issuance of an underpayment is manually modified, the dates of issuance will be based on a production schedule set by the Department. You can view underpayments within a product delivery case on the Over and Under Payments page in the Financials tab. Underpayments can only be created in Cúram via system generated reassessments. Any situations where Cúram is unable to reassess entitlement are manually calculated and issued outside of Cúram. Approval is required for underpayments and arrears that are above $15,000. In these situations, you must follow the Delegation of Authority process. Cúram does not automatically apply underpayments or arrears against existing overpayments to offset them. Whenever an underpayment or arrears is generated and there is an overpayment for the client, staff will need to manually apply any underpayments or arrears to the overpayment using the offset process. Action Description New Issue Arrears payments All arrears payments will be picked up on the next weekly payment date as per the national payment schedule, unless you provide any other payment method using the Issue Retro Pending Payments window. Alternative options are priority or monthly payment. New Approve offset records linked to underpayments The issuance of underpayment or arrears is based on an associated offset record’s status. New Voluntary Tax Deduction The deduction functionality is used to deduct Voluntary Tax Withhold (VTW) from a client’s OAS benefits. The deduction functionality cannot be manually created and managed. The deduction will be created and managed via the VTW evidence. When an initial VTW evidence is activated, Cúram will automatically create a deduction record. Cúram uses 3 fields on the Deductions page group navigation bar to determine if the deduction should be used in current gross to net payment calculation: Status Start Date End Date The deduction information can be viewed at the Person Record level and the Product Delivery Case level.

What you need to know You may need to add direct deposit information to a third-party's profile so that they can receive payment on behalf of the client. There are various third-party roles that can be designated as nominees in Cúram so they can receive a payment on behalf of the client. When you add a third party with their banking information for the first time, you must first add the third party's bank account using the Financials tab on their profile. Refer to Third Party Contacts—Add, View, Edit, and Delete in Cúram (Action) . Next, you go to the client's product delivery case and add the third party as a nominee. This changes the nominee on the case from the client to the third party and the direct deposit information to that of the third party. Note: The third party contact must meet defined criteria to be added as a case nominee. Refer to Manage Payment Destination for Nominees—Add, Edit and View in Cúram (Action) . When the third party reports a new bank account, you must use the New function to add new banking information, not Edit . The Edit function can only be used to correct previously entered incorrect information when payments have not been made to that account. Once the bank account information has been added, you use the Transfer function to automatically update the product delivery case. When the direct deposit for a third party is to take effect in the future, you must create a manual task. This task should be deferred and added to the third party's profile at that future date. The reason why a manual task is needed is because the system cannot capture a future dated direct deposit information for a third party. You must use the Transfer function to update product delivery case nominee details at that time. Note: For bulk payees, when you update the direct deposit information on the external party's profile and use the Transfer option, the banking information for all the individuals under the bulk payee is updated. Refer to Manage Tasks in Cúram (Action) . Note: If a user receives any validation message regarding missing, cancelled, closed, or duplicated bank branches when attempting to add a new bank account evidence, then you must send a ticket to the National Service Desk Internal link . New Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) receives data from Canadian financial institutions regarding changes to a client’s direct deposit information. Once PSPC verifies the Standard Payment System and performs updates, they will then create a Notice of Change File which is sent to the Department. New When the Notice of Change is received from PSPC to update direct deposit information, Cúram attempts to automatically update the direct deposit information for clients. If Cúram is unable to automatically update the direct deposit information based on the Notice of Change, a task will be generated. New You must review the client's information and manually add the direct deposit information. This will ensure that payment goes to the correct bank account.

What you need to know Eligibility and entitlement override evidence is used when the actual detailed evidence in Cúram is insufficient to achieve the intended determination of a client's eligibility and entitlement for OAS benefits. Overrides are rarely used. Circumstances when you would add an override include: when a ministerial request is received (e.g. the Minister states that the client is eligible for a pension or benefit or meets the legal status criterion.) to comply with the determination of a court case (e.g. if the Social Security Tribunal rules that a client should be paid $300.00 a month regardless of what is on the client's file, an override would be created to reflect that judgement.) Note: An override is always created manually; it is not automatically triggered by Cúram. You can only add an override to a case when directed to do so. Note: There will be system generated overrides in Cúram due to data migration. This article strictly deals with post-migration override evidence. Note: Future determinations will use the override unless it is removed or changed. The evidence exists in both Application Cases and Integrated Cases. If the OAS benefit is not approved, the eligibility and entitlement override evidence is maintained in the Application Case. If the benefit is authorized, the eligibility and entitlement override evidence is maintained in the Integrated Case. Note: Eligibility and entitlement override evidence can be added, viewed, and deleted in the Application Case but not edited. To edit the evidence in the Application Case, you must delete the existing evidence and re-enter it. The evidence can be edited in the Integrated Case.

If an individual was created as a prospect person because their information was received directly from a restricted International Social Security Agreement country and all the information becomes available from a non-restricted source (e.g. the client provides an application for Canadian benefits, an application for foreign benefits is received from a non-restricted country or a non-restricted foreign country provides the client’s information), you need to convert the prospect person profile to a person profile. If a prospect person applies for an OAS pension or benefit, you must first convert the prospect person to a person in Cúram.

What you need to know The client is designated as the nominee by default. However, if an authorized individual or an organization will receive the benefit payments on behalf of a client, they can be designated as a nominee. An individual or an organization must be registered in Cúram either as a representative or external party participant before being added as a nominee to a client's product delivery case. Refer to Application Case, Integrated Case and Product Delivery Case in Cúram (Knowledge) . Multiple case nominees can be added; however, only one case nominee can be the current nominee. The following criteria must be met to add a person and third party contacts as a case nominee: The case is an OAS Product Delivery Case and the client has an Active status for the OAS program. The third party contact must have no end date specified. If there is an end-date associated with the third party contact, you must update it before adding the third party contact as the case nominee. The nominee must have one of the following third party contact role types: Administrator Appointed by the Courts Bulk Pay/Public Trustee Executor For the Estate of Legal Representative of the Estate Post-mortem Business Trustee Accounting Trustee Non-Accounting Estate Representative Tutor Mandatary (where 'Power Of Attorney (POA)/Mandate Type' = 'Protection) Liquidator To add: a representative, refer to Third Party Contacts—Add, View, Edit, and Delete in Cúram (Action) . an External Party Participant, refer to Register a Third-Party Organization, Office and Office Member in Cúram (Action) . Only third party contacts that meet the criteria and have an Active status can be added as nominees for a client. The third party contact must have a valid bank account and/or a mailing address on their account. Refer to Third Party Contacts—Add, View, Edit, and Delete in Cúram (Action) . H2 Exp-coll: Establishing payment method and frequency for nominees You must select a delivery pattern for the payment before saving the nominee. The delivery pattern specifies the type of payment (i.e. cheque or direct deposit) and the frequency at which the nominee will receive the payment (monthly, semi-annually, etc.). When the delivery pattern payment type is set to Cheque , a mailing address must be on file. When you assign a new case nominee, you must also assign the dedicated delivery pattern. You can select and change between the available nominees. When a Public Trustee is initially set up, a method of payment is already specified. Therefore, when you add a Public Trustee as a nominee for a client, you must first review the Public Trustee profile to verify the specified method of payment and frequency and ensure you select it as the Delivery Pattern . H2 Exp-coll: Deleting a third party nominee When a payment has been made to a third party nominee, you will not be able to delete them from the Product Delivery Case. You will be able to end date the third party nominee; however, the status of the nominee will still be Active . You will receive an error message if you try to designate them as a nominee. If the third party has not received a payment, the third party contact can be deleted. When a third party nominee was added in error and no payment was made to the third party nominee, you can delete the third party nominee. The third party nominee will still be displayed on Product Delivery Case with a status of Inactive . For more information, refer to Third Party Contacts—Add, View, Edit, and Delete in Cúram (Action) . H2 Exp-coll: Updating nominee address and direct deposit information To change address or direct deposit information of the nominee, you must add the new address or direct deposit information in the Third Party's profile. This change will automatically update the address or direct deposit for the nominee on the Product Delivery Case. If the mailing address is updated on the Third Party's profile, it will update the mailing address on the nominee record automatically. Both the mailing and residential address will show in the Change Nominee Address drop-down menu but there is no need to use this as the address is updated when the mailing address is updated on the representative profile. Bring forward tasks may need to be created for future dated nominee changes to banking or address information. When creating bring forward tasks for future dated nominees, the category OAS – maintenance must be selected followed by selecting the applicable type of task. Refer to Manage Tasks in Cúram (Action) to create a bring forward task. H2 Exp-coll: Bank Account Fraud List New When a domestic bank account is added or edited, Cúram automatically reviews the details and compares them against the Bank Account Fraud List. If the account information matches an entry on the fraud list, the validation check will fail, and the bank account evidence cannot be applied. In such cases, a task is automatically generated and sent for further review. This process does not impact the authorization of benefits. The client will still receive payment, which will be issued by cheque. Top tab: Step by Step What you need to do H2 Exp-coll: Add a new nominee In Cúram, go to the person's profile.

What you need to know The Incarceration evidence captures information about a client's period of incarceration. It is used by Eligibility and Entitlement to assess entitlement to benefits for both the incarcerated individual and their spouse or common-law partner. Since a person may be incarcerated multiple times, you can add multiple incarceration records. During the period of incarceration, the circumstances of incarceration may change (e.g. a different institution or offender status). The Effective Date of Change field is used to track changes of information during an incarceration period. The client's incarceration institution is linked in the evidence as a case participant. When you create a new incarceration evidence, you add an institution by searching for a service supplier and selecting it. This associates the institution with the evidence. If the client has previously been incarcerated, those institutions are listed in the related drop-down menu, allowing you to select that institution if the client has re-entered it. When you modify incarceration evidence, the institution drop-down menu is populated with the current institution name. The evidence exists in both Application Cases and Integrated Cases. If the OAS benefit is not approved, the incarceration evidence is maintained in the Application Case. If the benefit is authorized and approved, the incarceration evidence is maintained in the Integrated Case. Note: Bill-C591 requires that no payments of survivor’s pension, death benefit or orphan’s benefit to an individual who has been convicted of first or second degree murder or manslaughter of the contributor. It also amends the Old Age Security Act to prohibit the payment of a survivor’s allowance to an individual who has been convicted of first or second degree murder or manslaughter of the individual's spouse or common-law partner.

What you need to know The consent to deduction and payments evidence captures the client's consent to reimburse benefits to the Social Assistance Agency. Additionally, there is a sub-evidence called "social assistance payment." The social assistance payments evidence captures the payment amounts that were paid by the Social Assistance Agency to the client. This amount may be reimbursed from the OAS pension payments and/or income tested benefits (i.e. GIS or ALW and ALWS benefits). Clients who are eligible for income tested benefit or pension payments (i.e. OAS pension, GIS , ALW and ALWS benefits) may receive payments from a Social Assistance Agency (municipal or provincial) for the same period. The Social Assistance Agency can request reimbursement for the payments by submitting a valid Consent to Deduction and Payment - Old Age Security (ISP-3010) form to recover all or part of the amount paid to the individual when pension and/or income tested benefit payments (OAS pension, GIS , ALW and ALWS benefits) are issued. Upon receiving the ISP-3010 form from the Social Assistance Agency, you must make sure it is registered as an external party in Cúram before updating the evidence. Note: Only add Social Assistance Agencies that are based in Canada. In Cúram, the consent to deduction and payment evidence is the parent evidence of the social assistance payments. You must ensure the consent to deduction and payment evidence is active before making any changes to the social assistance payments evidence. The evidence exists in Application Cases and Integrated Cases and can also exist in the Person / Prospect Person profile. Note: When an ISP-3010 form has been received but there is insufficient information to register the client, you can create a Prospect Person to capture the Consent to Deduction evidence. Once further information about the client has been received, then the Prospect person can be upgraded to a Person. If the benefit is not approved, the consent to deduction and payments evidence is maintained in the Application Case. If the benefit is approved, the consent to deduction and payments evidence is automatically brokered to and maintained in the Integrated Case. If the client is found to be ineligible within 12 months of receiving the ISP-3010 form, then a Department's representative must manually send a rejection letter to the Social Assistance Agency.

It also provides you with the steps to request CRA data as evidence for a case. What you need to know The CRA income evidence contains income information shared by the CRA . This evidence may impact a client's eligibility and entitlement for income-tested benefits. Cúram will request CRA income data: when an application for an income-tested benefit is submitted; and/or when the request to add a client to the CRA Lifetime List is sent. As a result of the request, the CRA will automatically return the income information for the base calendar year and the following years. Updated You only need to perform a manual request if there is no available income data and you have determined that this information is required to assess eligibility. In those cases, you can manually request a person’s CRA income data by using the New CRA Request wizard in the Interfaces tab in an Application Case or an Integrated Case. Updated Regardless of how Cúram receives CRA income data, the data may need to be reviewed and validated. Refer to Validate Income for Income-Tested Benefits (Action) . The CRA income evidence cannot be edited, discarded or deleted. If you find any discrepancies or if you need to amend a client's income information, you must create a Manually Entered Income evidence for the appropriate tax year. Refer to Manually Entered Income Evidence—Add, Edit, View and Delete in Cúram (Action) . New Historical data migrated from CRA income records can be viewed from an Integrated Case in the CRA Income Data section of the Interfaces tab in an Integrated Case. These records are migrated with the line-by-line income information and are identified by the Request Type set to Migration . If the Request Type is set to Migration , no evidence will be created. New If the migrated historical CRA data includes Block 7 – Net Employment Income or Block 8 – Net Self-Employment Income , there may be a discrepancy between the total income of the migrated CRA Income evidence and the total income of the migrated CRA Interface data as the earnings exemption is not applied to historical data migrated from CRA income. It is only reflected on the CRA Income evidence’s total. New When migrated historical income is required to determine eligibility, you must create a Manually Entered Income evidence for the appropriate tax year. Refer to Manually Entered Income Evidence—Add, Edit, View and Delete in Cúram (Action) . New Note: For CRA Interface records with a Request Type of Migration , the CRA SIN , CRA Surname , CRA Birth Date and Date of Death fields are populated based on the client’s data in Cúram.

What you need to know A task refers to a specific unit of work that needs to be completed as part of a larger process, or workflow. It represents an individual or collection of actions or activities that are assigned to a user within the system. These actions or activities could include reviewing documentation, collecting information, and updating evidence. Tasks are often associated with a prospect person, person, or a type of case. These tasks are used to manage and track the progress of work related to the associated target. In Cúram, tasks are created in two ways. Primarily, tasks are generated automatically by the system based on predefined rules and workflows. However, Cúram also allows the manual creation of tasks by users. Manual task creation is only to be used in specific scenarios. Each task contains attributes, history and comments, assignments, time worked, and relevant links to supporting pages based on the prospect person, person, application, or type of case. Task attributes are a set of details used to capture a task's name, status, priority, category, urgency, and more. The combination of task attributes provides key insight as to what the task is about, what information is available, what work has been previously done on the task, and what is the relevant priority for the task. Inbox A user's Inbox is the centralized location where tasks are received and managed. At any given time, a user can navigate to their inbox and review their workload. Tasks are allocated to the users based on a user's location, language, skill type (virtual skills group), and availability. At the start of a shift, and throughout the workday, users should navigate to their inbox to review their existing workload and workload that has newly been assigned. Under Inbox is the "My Tasks" tab that displays all tasks reserved to the logged in user. The "My Tasks" tab is divided in two pages: My Open Tasks, and My Deferred Tasks. In My Open Tasks, a user can view tasks that have been started, have not yet been started, or stopped. In Deferred Tasks, a user can view all tasks that have been deferred. In both task spaces, the full details of each task is displayed. All tasks in a user's Inbox are sorted by default based on their importance in being completed. While this sorting is used to indicate where a user should start, it does not prevent a user from completing other tasks in their Inbox. Note: If you previously had any Release1 tasks that were assigned, but not reserved you must first use the Available Tasks link to search for the forwarded task. Tasks that are forwarded to you and in your Available Tasks must be manually reserved as they are not part of the work queue for reporting purposes. Once you reserve the forwarded task to yourself, it will be available to view under My Open Tasks . All tasks have 4 statuses: Open On Hold Deferred Closed Note: The status of a task is Open when it is created. Tasks can be modified based on the task actions. This includes: Table 1. Task types and descriptions Task action Description Start Work This task action moves a user's task from the Stopped Work / Work Not Started list to the Started Work list. Stop Work This task action moves a user's task from the Started Work list to the Stopped Work / Work Not Started list. Add Comment This task action allows a user to add comments to a task. Edit Task This task action allows a user to update the category, type, skill type, and priority level of a task. Edit Due / Receipt Date This task action allows a user to update the due date and receipt date of a task. Bring Forward This task action allows a user to set the task to On Hold status until the bring forward date. This task will be allocated to the assigned work queue until the Bring Forward Date and will not show in the user's My Tasks list . Once the Bring Forward Date arrives, the system will set the task status back to Open . Make Available This task action makes the task available to the previous assigned. The user will no longer see the task in their My Open Tasks list. Forward This task action allows a user to forward a task assigned to them, to another user or work queue. Team leads can forward tasks that are not assigned to them. These tasks can be viewed in the Open Tasks page of the processing user's workspace or in the work queue workspace. Note: You must only use the Forward... function to reassign a task to another colleague. Do not use the Reallocate... function as that will not reassign the task correctly. Reallocate This task action allows a user to remove the task from their inbox and re-run the allocation strategy that initially allocated the task at creation. Defer This task action allows a user to set the task to Deferred status until the restart date. A task is deferred, and the task status is updated to Deferred . It will remain in the user's inbox and move into the My Deferred Tasks page. Restart This task action allows a user to manually restart a deferred task and return it to the user's My Open Tasks list. Complete This task action allows a user to update the status of a task to Completed. Note: To close a task, it must be reserved to you and in your My Open Tasks . All ongoing reserved tasks are under My Open Tasks , and all your deferred tasks are under My Deferred Tasks . When you defer an open task, you will record a restart date and the status of the task is updated from Open to Deferred . After the restart date, the deferred task will automatically reopen and move from My Deferred Tasks to My Open Tasks . You must review all ongoing tasks under My Open Tasks to determine if it is a new task or a previously deferred task that requires attention. Tasks will disappear from the list of tasks once they are closed. In each task, you will be able to: Close the task if it is completed. Note: To close a task, it must be reserved to you and in your My Open Tasks . Add a comment to the task for additional notes. Defer the task to a later date if you are waiting for a client's missing information and cannot proceed with the open task. Note: To work on a deferred task, you must restart the deferred task manually to open it. Forward the task to another colleague. Note: You must only use the Forward... function to reassign a task to another colleague. Do not use the Reallocate... function as that will not reassign the task correctly. Edit the category, type and skill type. Note: Relevant tasks must be closed before authorization. Some tasks, such as the Application Case task, will close automatically when the case is authorized, but failure to address other tasks may cause errors when authorizing the Application Case. In each task, the context panel shows the task properties: Table 2 — Field and Detail in the Task Tab Field Detail Status This field lists the status of the tasks. Reserved To This field shows whom this task is reserved to. Due Date This field lists the deadline to complete the task. Priority This field lists the priority of the task. Last Assigned This field lists when this task was last assigned. Skill type This field lists the skill type (virtual skill group - VSG) level of the task. Urgent Flags This field indicates if an urgent flag is raised in the task. Escalation Level This field indicates the escalation level for the task: Escalation Level 1 means 15 days to complete. Escalation Level 2 means 2 days to complete. Escalation Levels 3 to 8 mean one day to complete. Category This field indicates the category of the task. Refer to section Task categories and types for a full list of task categories. Type This field indicates the specific type of the task under Category . Refer to section Task categories and types for a full list of task types. Red clock icon If a task is past due, a red clock icon displays under Category . The subject of the task is shown next to the icon. In each task, there are 4 tabs under the context panel: Table 3 — Tab Name and Details for Tasks Tab Name Details Home This tab lists applicable hyperlinks under Primary Action and Supporting Information . Links under Primary Action direct you to carry out the primary action of the task. Links under Supporting Information direct you to supplemental information. History and Comments This tab records all the change actions on this task. You can also see comments entered on the task. Assignments This tab lists whom the task is assigned to. Time Worked The time that a task has been worked on by user(s). Automatic Tasks Predefined rules and workflows define the conditions and sequences in which tasks are automatically generated in Cúram. These predefined rules and conditions consider OAS business processes, activities in the client lifecycle (new applications, client maintenance), and interactions with integrated systems. Some examples include: An underpayment or arrears payment has exceeded threshold, and an authorization is required by a delegated authority. A client reports a change in residency, and the change must be reviewed for its impact on the client's benefits. A payment issue has been reported from the Standard Payment System (SPS), and the account must be investigated in Cúram. All incoming paper documents (including applications) designated with a scan location of Virtual in the Pension Trusted Digital Repository are automatically re-routed to the appropriate regional queue in Cúram based on the captured metadata. Team leaders and OAS administrators will have to monitor the workload in the OAS-INTAKE-ERROR-TASKS manual work queue to identify tasks that fail to be directed to the appropriate work queue through the automated process. Manual Tasks A user can create a manual task from their Inbox, prospect person, person, or case for specific purposes and assign it to a work queue. A user may create a manual task for the following reasons: Investigation Referral or Report Resolving Verifications for Dire Need Cases Manual Maintenance of Client Evidence Potential Duplicate Accounts You must create a manual task when you suspect that there may be a duplicate record of the same client when searching for a client in Cúram. If you need to merge duplicate records, refer to Merge Records and Access Merged Foreign Engagement Cases to Update a Master Person's Record in Cúram (Action) and Manage Duplicate Person Records in Cúram (Action) . Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) receives data from Canadian financial institutions regarding changes to a client's direct deposit information. Once PSPC verifies the SPS and performs updates, they will then create a Notice of Change File which is sent to the Department. When the Notice of Change is received from PSPC to update direct deposit information, Cúram attempts to automatically update the direct deposit information for clients. If Cúram is unable to automatically update the direct deposit information based on the Notice of Change, a task will be generated. You must review the client's information and manually add the direct deposit information. This will ensure that payment goes to the correct bank account.

H2 Exp-coll: Transferring a Person or a Case When a user makes an update to a client's specific evidence, such as residence or address, Cúram will automatically reflect the changes in the client's Office of Control (OCON). The Office of Control (OCON) evidence can be found, and reviewed on the client's person evidence case, under Active Evidence . Additionally, a task is generated indicating that the Office of Control has been updated, and to transfer the physical file to the correct Office of Control. This task will be assigned to the OCON that generated the task. Once this task is reserved to a user either through the user reserving the task to themselves, or it being reserved to a user through auto-allocation, the user will reserve the client's tasks to the appropriate work queue based on the client's updated OCON. This would include transfers between OAS Domestic and International Operations (IO), and regional transfers. In Cúram, go to the client's profile. Refer to Search for a Person in Cúram (Action) .

Click the Select hyperlink of the work queue. The Select Work Queue window will close, and you will return to the Forward Task window. Click Save . Note: This must be done for all the tasks that must be forwarded. Once the user has forwarded the client's task(s) to the appropriate work queue, the user can complete the transfer file task. Note: If there is a need to move the physical file, follow your existing process. H2 Exp-coll: Handling Tasks With No Linked Person or Prospect Person If an agent receives a task that is not linked to a Person or Prospect Person in Cúram, and the Person or Prospect Person cannot be identified using the supporting information, links, and attachments in the task, a ticket must be raised to Operations to retrieve the original PWS task for the agent. Based on the details in the original PWS task, the agent should navigate to Cúram to identify the client and continue the related workload, or if the work is no longer applicable, update the task status to complete. If an agent must stop, defer, bring forward, reallocate, forward, or make the work available, the agent can add a comment with additional information to the unlinked task using the instructions found in the Add comments to a task section above. H2 Exp-coll: Work queues A work queue is a central repository that organizes, holds, and tracks the tasks that need to be completed within the system. Work queues are used to manage and monitor user-created, or system-generated workload. There are two types of work queues: automatic work queues and manual work queues. Team members will only be subscribed to manual work queues. Team leads will be subscribed to both automatic and manual work queues to monitor workload, however, team leads will only subscribe team members to manual queues. Automatic work queues are used to hold tasks that can be automatically assigned by the system to users. Manual work queues are used to manage specific tasks that require manual intervention for allocation. A campaign work queue is a work queue created a result of an organization-planned activity or an event. It is organized with the purpose to complete an identified set of tasks by a specific group of staff members. Work queues have been configured specifically for Old Age Security (OAS). In addition to automatic and manual work queue configurations, work queues are defined by region and purpose. Each region has a respective automatic and manual work queue Additionally, there are different work queues based on region (region or national), type of workload (migrated from legacy or generated in Cúram), and work queues by business units. Table 9 – Types of work queues Type of work queue Description Work queue example National work queues Represents a work queue with tasks allocated irrespective of region. One-Workload-Processing One-Workload- PWS -Migrated Regional work queues Represents a work queue with tasks allocated respective of region. OAS-WT-Processing OAS-QC-Processing PWS (legacy) work queues Represents a work queue holding tasks migrated from PWS . OAS-ATL- PWS -Migrated-Automated New task (Cúram-generated) work queues Represents a work queue holding tasks generated by Cúram. OAS-ATL-Processing Work queues by business units Represents a work queue for a specific business unit for their own specific workload. These are part of other types of work queues. OAS-QC-Processing CSB-QC ISB-OAS-NHQ CC-WT-Pensions IO-WT-Processing OAS-Foreign-Direct-Deposit Incarceration-Processing Error work queue Represents a work queue for tasks that fail to be automatically sent to the appropriate regional work queue.

What you need to know A deduction is an amount withheld from a payment. The maximum deduction amount is the amount that can be deducted to recover overpayments, penalties, and interest from a pay-run (gross to net). Note: The maximum deduction amount it is calculated based on the current policy rules. The CPP benefit entitlement is excluded from the calculation. The maximum deduction amount will be stored on the Product Delivery Case and displayed on the Overpayment Case for reference. The maximum deduction amount is not associated to a single deduction. It is the common deduction amount that is linked to all active overpayment, penalty, and interest deductions. The maximum deduction amount is equal to the recovery rate that will be withheld from benefit payments to repay monies owed to the Department. Note: The maximum deduction amount is applicable to departmental liabilities and is not used for third party liabilities. If the Auto Calculate box is checked, Cúram will auto calculate and create the maximum deduction amount after the following trigger events: Note: If you manually edit the maximum deduction amount, you must make sure you uncheck the Auto Calculate box to have it applied. Overpayment update triggers An Overpayment Case (manual Overpayment Case or Payment Correction Case) is activated. There is a change in future OAS eligibility and entitlement. An Overpayment Case is suspended or unsuspended. Note: When an Overpayment Case is suspended or unsuspended, Cúram will deactivate or active the associated deduction and recalculate the maximum deduction amount. Penalty and interest triggers A new penalty or interest is added and there is no existing maximum deduction amount. A new penalty or interest is added for a current and future existing maximum deduction amount. A new penalty or interest initial liability amount is updated, and the new amount is more than the running outstanding liability balance, the current and future maximum deduction amount. Manually triggers You manually edit a maximum deduction amount line item (recovery amount or recovery percentage) and the Auto Calculate box is unchecked. Note: You must clear the Auto Calculate box to have the manually entered maximum deduction amount used for the deduction by Cúram. The deduction will start 60 days after the activation of debt or the maximum deduction amount. Note: These triggers update existing overpayment(s) and deduction(s) by recalculating the maximum deduction amount.

What you need to know When a death notification is received, the date of death must be added to the birth and death details evidence as soon as possible because it will impact any OAS pension and benefits the client is currently receiving. Once the date of death is added or updated on the birth and death details evidence and activated, Cúram will run a reassessment to ensure that the account is in balance. If, at anytime during the reassessment process, the account is not in balance, the system is unable to perform actions automatically, or when there is a conflicting date of death received or the existing date of death is removed via the ITRDS Interface, a task will be generated for manual review. As part of the reassessment process, Cúram will automatically: Update the spouse's Marital Relationship evidence to Surviving Spouse/Common Law Partner , if applicable. If the system is unable to update the Marital Relationship evidence of the spouse, it will create a task for the processing centre to review the account; Send the Surviving Spouse OAS Rate Change (ISP-3393) letter outlining the new monthly benefit, if monetary changes are detected for the spouse; Send the Client has died outside of Canada (ISS-2388) letter, if the death occurred outside of Canada; and Generate a task to review the account if there are any existing overpayment or underpayment and/or any new overpayment or underpayment generated because of the date of death (e.g. the date of death was reported late). Note: If the date of death evidence is not activated, no reassessments are performed. Instead, the date of death is placed in an In Edit status pending verification and activation. Therefore, to stop a client's benefits, the death evidence must be activated. Date of Death received via ITRDS The ITRDS interface will send a Date of Death notification to Cúram when proof of death is provided from source CPP or source SIR-PRV-C . Once the date of death evidence is updated in Cúram, it is automatically activated, and a reassessment is performed. Note: If proof of death is not provided for source CPP , then the date of death will still be sent to Cúram but the evidence will remain in an In Edit status until it is manually activated. No reassessment occurs until the evidence is activated. Since the ITRDS Interface automatically activates the date of death evidence in Cúram, there are certain scenarios where reports will be generated to ensure additional actions are taken on the account. The gaps listed below have been placed on the enhancement backlog and are scheduled to be built in future Cúram iterations. Until permanent fixes are developed, the following workarounds have been established for each scenario: Table 1—Development Gaps and Workarounds Gap Workaround The client is suspended in Cúram for the following reasons: Cannot locate ISB Request OAS-RI Non-Filer Other A report will identify any clients that have a date of death and where the client is suspended for one of the reasons listed in the Gap column. The report will be used to create tasks to notify users that a date of death has been received for the client. The client is under investigation by the Integrity Services Branch (ISB) and is in-pay for benefits A report will identify any clients that have a date of death and are under ISB investigation while in pay for benefits. The report will be used to create tasks to notify ISB. The client is incarcerated A report will identify any clients that have a date of death and are incarcerated. The report will be used to create tasks to notify the Incarceration team. There is an existing date of death in Cúram and a new date of death with a different month/year is interfaced from ITRDS A report will be generated to identify any instance where an existing date of death in Cúram has been replaced with a new date of death from ITRDS . The report will be used to create a task so that a user can review the account to ensure the date of death is accurate. There is an existing date of death in Cúram and ITRDS removes the date of death A report will be generated to identify any instance where an existing Cúram date of death was removed via ITRDS . The report will be used to create tasks so that a user can review the account to ensure that the removal was appropriate. Surviving Spouse OAS Rate Change (ISP-3393) letter The automation of the Surviving Spouse OAS Rate Change (ISP-3393) letter cannot be performed by Cúram in the 2 following scenarios: This letter is OAS pension/ GIS specific and does not cover situations where the ALW benefit is converted to the ALWS benefit. This letter is only generated when there is a monetary impact to the surviving spouse. However, it also needs to be generated any time there is a reassessment under a different rate table. To mitigate these risks, a report will be generated to identify any of the above situations. The report will be used to create tasks so that a user can manually send any appropriate letters as needed. Migrated Client records Updated For client accounts that have been migrated with a date of death, the Birth and Death details will be in the In-Edit state and will need to be verified. This can be done following the steps in the Add proof and Apply death details evidence sections under the What you need to do in the Step by Step tab.

What you need to know Clients can submit a request for reconsideration anytime they disagree with a decision made on their case. The client must submit a request for reconsideration within 90 days of the date of the decision letter from Service Canada. The request for reconsideration can be submitted using the Request for Reconsideration of an Old Age Security Decision (ISP-3134) form or online through the client portal. Note: You must not authorize any benefit application when there is an open reconsideration for the client. When a client submits a request for reconsideration from the client portal, a request for reconsideration task is created in the appropriate work queue. Cúram automatically displays a corresponding reconsideration flag on the context panel for the Person or Prospect Person and associated case for the client. When a written request for reconsideration is processed, a task is created in Cúram that shows the client's SIN or Cúram Reference Number, the client's name, and Request for Reconsideration for the Type. The request is also listed as an attachment under the Contacts tab. You must manually add a flag to the client's profile to indicate it is under reconsideration. When the reconsideration is closed, you must remove the flag. When there is a reconsideration on an account with an overpayment that resulted from the decision the client is requesting the reconsideration for, recovery action must be deferred if it has not been initiated. If recovery has already been initiated, then it must be suspended until the outcome of the reconsideration, or the appeal is known. You should manually de-activate a payment correction or overpayment (manual) case deduction for a departmental liability. Note: If there is an existing overpayment on the client's account (i.e. misrepresentation or fraud that was carried over), the overpayment is not suspended and remains active.

What you need to know Correspondence (i.e. letters) are created in Cúram to communicate with a client or a verified third party on a Person record, Application Case, Integrated Case and/or a Foreign Engagement Case. If you cannot find the correspondence template in Cúram, updated versions are available on the Forms and Letters page of the KMT. You must search for NATS letters temporarily stored on the KMT before searching in NATS. There are 3 types of letters being generated out of Cúram with the Corporate Correspondence Tool (CCT): bulk letters; on demand letters; and manual letters. Table 1—Types of letters in the CCT Type of letter Description Bulk letters Bulk correspondence (also known as "bulk letters") are high volume letters sent to clients on a set schedule. This schedule can be daily, weekly, monthly or yearly, depending on the type of letter. Client data in Cúram determines who will be scheduled to receive each type of scheduled bulk letter. Bulk correspondence is generated automatically by the CCT with a data file created by Cúram through a system process and is sent to the CCT to produce the correspondence. Clients are selected to receive each type of scheduled bulk letter based on changes made to their personal or case record. The list of clients who meet the criteria for each bulk letter is created by Cúram and sent to the CCT to create the letters. Each type of bulk correspondence has a specific template. New Cúram will automatically prevent the generation of bulk letters for clients marked as duplicates. On demand letters On demand letters include 5 specific letters: Application for the Allowance or Allowance for the Survivor (ISS-3008) Application for the Guaranteed Income Supplement with Statement of Income (ISS-3025B/ISB-3026) Statement of Income for the GIS , the ALW or ALWS (ISS-3026) OAS Cancellation of Waiver of Application by Minister (ISS-8418B/ISP3550) Client has died outside of Canada (ISS-2388) These system-generated letters are printed in the manual nightly batch printing process. Manual correspondence Manual correspondence generation can be submitted for nightly bulk printing. This allows the system to generate bulk correspondence for a targeted group of clients or recipients when required. For every letter created (bulk, on demand or manual), a correspondence tracking number and a communication record is created in Cúram. Note: The client's mailing address and preferred language must be set in the Person record to be able to create correspondence. All correspondence is displayed on the Person record, but only the correspondence specific to a case are created and displayed on the Case record. To create a letter, you must specify the recipients of the correspondence, select a template to use, and complete all mandatory data/selections and/or all required options. A pop-up interface with the CCT is used to complete the template and generate the correspondence. Refer to Confirmed Priority ISS Template Titles – 2024-07-17 (Excel, 44 KB) Download link for a current list of available templates. Once the correspondence template has been opened, a hyperlink is created based on the correspondence tracking number and work item generated for that letter. Note: The hyperlink is only enabled if the communication status is set to Draft , Submitted , Sent or Returned . If required, you can submit an incomplete application to enable you to generate correspondence from the Application Case. H2 Exp-coll: Central printing Central Printing is where the bulk printing occurs, where manual letters would be produced in a nightly batch. This is the default method unless the letter does not meet the requirements for bulk printing. The process of centrally printing correspondence is available for most scenarios. A letter must not be greater than 5 physical pages (shows as 10 pages in a PDF due to double sided (duplex) printing) including pages from attachments added to the letter. The letter and attachment must be the same page size (i.e. 8.5x11 inches and 8.5x14 inches are distinct sizes and cannot be combined for central printing). The size is based on the page size of the template, not the size of the attachment. Once this letter has been submitted for printing, Cúram will change the communication status from Submitted to Sent , when the print file is sent to the print provider. H2 Exp-coll: Local printing Local printing is used when requirements are not met for the nightly batch requirements. If the letter is more than 5 physical pages duplexed, the CCT will remove the letter from the print file. Cúram sets the communication status to Submitted Oversize after the nightly print job has been completed. Once the process is completed, a task to manually print the letter is generated and assigned back to the Department's representative who created the letter or the processing work queue for task assignment. The task includes the correspondence tracking number. Note: The option to print locally is available if you already know the correspondence is oversized to avoid any delay in getting the letter printed. When using local print, you must check the Confirm Delivery to ensure Cúram changes the status from Draft or Submitted to Sent . H2 Exp-coll: Communication status Cúram will change the Communication Status to Sent for any central printing letters. Some of the following statuses can be changed manually. The following status are available in Cúram: Table 2—Available Communication status Status Description Draft The Draft status is displayed once the template has been selected and all mandatory data is populated and Edit after Submit has been selected to open the template. This will create the hyperlink to the letter in Cúram, along with the Correspondence Tracking Number for this letter. Submitted The Submitted status is a transition state that indicates a letter has been submitted for printing and is awaiting the delivery options that are associated with the letter to complete. For central printing, it will show in this state until the nightly batch is completed. For local printing, this status will show before Confirm Delivery has been selected. Sent The Sent status is displayed automatically by Cúram when a manual or system-generated correspondence has successfully been bulk printed, or when a manual correspondence has been locally printed (once the user confirms delivery). Submitted Oversized The Submitted Oversized status is displayed by Cúram when the manual nightly print job has failed because a letter is over the 5-page maximum allowed by Central Print (manual only). A task will be generated and assigned back to the processing work queue for task assignment. Misdirected The Misdirected status is manually updated in Cúram when correspondence is sent to a wrong recipient and is potentially a privacy breach. This status removes access to the correspondence in the vault by removing the hyperlink to the letter. This status can be manually changed. Returned The Returned status is used when the correspondence is returned. This status is updated manually in Cúram. Once the status is updated, a task ("TASK-07 Review nature of absence evidence") will be generated. This status can be manually changed. Void The Void status is used when the correspondence has been identified as incorrect. This status removes access to the correspondence in the vault by removing the hyperlink to the letter. This status can be manually changed. Intercepted The Intercepted status will display in Cúram when the request to pull a letter from a bulk or nightly batch file was successfully pulled before it was mailed to the client. Only Central Print can change this status. Top tab: Step by Step What you need to do H2 Exp-coll: Create correspondence in a client's record In Cúram, go to the client's profile.

What you need to know Users that are team leads will have a team-lead application banner, including Home, Team and Workloads, and Inbox subsections in Cúram. The Team and Workloads subsection includes two supervisor-specific workspaces: Supervisor User Workspace ; and Supervisor Work Queue Workspace . Supervisor User Workspace The Supervisor User Workspace provides the ability for team leads to view, monitor and maintain workloads for users that report to them. This includes viewing users' tasks that are Assigned , Open , and Deferred . Team leads are also able to forward and reallocate tasks from a user to another user or work queue, respectively. This is available under My Users , located under the "My Users" header on the Shortcuts panel. From the My Users page, team leads can view the list of all users reporting to them and see a count of their reserved or assigned tasks as a dashboard. It also allows the team lead to quickly view the prioritized skills, post training monitoring skills and language for their user. Team leads can search for other users in the system to manage their workload. This may be used when covering for another supervisor or supporting a team lead and managing their team. Team leads also have 2 supervisor-specific searches: Supervisor User Search ; and Supervisor Task Search. Team leads can search for other users in the system to manage their workload. This may be used when covering for another supervisor or supporting a team lead and managing their team. Team leads can navigate into a specific user's workspace to manage their workload. A team lead can use the Supervisor User Search to navigate to a user's workspace who is directly on their team, or of a team they are supporting. Alternatively, if the user is a team member, the team lead can use the My Users list and navigate to the user's workspace directly through the hyperlinked Name of the team member . Supervisor Work Queue Workspace My Work Queues is the list of work queues that the team lead is monitoring. The team lead can subscribe to any work queue they wish to monitor. This list displays the number of tasks assigned to each of the listed work queues, allowing the user to understand the current outstanding workload. This can be found in My Work Queues, under My Users in the shortcuts panel. The Subscribed Work Queues tab lists the work queues subscribed by various organizational objects to which the team lead is associated to. For OAS, this is limited to subscription to users. The Work Queue Workspace allows team leads the ability to view, monitor and maintain workloads within the queue. It also provides essential information about a work queue. Within this workspace, you can find the following details regarding a work queue: Work Queue Owner; User Subscription Allowed: Serves as a reference to identify whether users can subscribe themselves to that work queue; Sensitivity level: For a user to add themselves to a particular work queue, their sensitivity level must match or exceed that of the work queue. Currently, all work queues have a sensitivity level set to 1, indicating the minimum requirement for user subscription; Users subscribed; Assigned tasks; and Reserved tasks. Subscribing to a work queue will allow a team lead to access a work queue's workload. A team lead should only subscribe to a work queue that they wish to monitor and to manage the users that should be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the work queue. Team leads can subscribe to work queues that are either automated or manual and align to their region or business unit. Note: Team members should only be subscribed to the manual work queues that correspond to their specific program (OAS or International Operations (IO)), business line (Processing, Citizen Services Branch, Integrity Services Branch (ISB), Call Centre) and region (ATL, QC, ON, WT, NHQ). However, some staff members (e.g. team leads, regional and national workload managers) may subscribe to additional work queues (manual and automated) based on functional requirements and organizational workload strategies. If a team lead determines that a task must be sent to a CPP team for further processing, a team lead should use the existing procedures to create a PWS item related to CPP. If there is no additional work to be completed in Cúram, the task can be completed. New All incoming paper documents (including applications) designated in the Pension Trusted Digital Repository (PTDR) with a scan location of Virtual are automatically re-routed in Cúram to the appropriate regional queue. Team leads and OAS administrators must monitor the workload in the “OAS-INTAKE-ERROR-TASKS” manual work queue to identify tasks that fail to be directed to the appropriate work queue through this automated process. Tasks are automatically allocated to the appropriate regional work queue based on the PTDR metadata. For more information on the work queues, refer to section Work Queues . For more information on the countries for which each IO office is responsible for, refer to Foreign Benefits - International Social Security Agreements Countries . You can access the work queue workspace under your subscription to manage the tasks in that work queue. Each work queue workspace has 3 tabs: Table 1-Tabs under the Work Queue Workspace Tab Details Home The Home tab displays the list of subscribed users of the work queue. Assigned Tasks The Assigned Tasks tab allows you to search for available tasks in the work queue that have not been forwarded or reserved to anyone. These tasks can be reserved to a processing team member from this tab. Note: The Assigned Task page will display tasks that are assigned to the user but not yet reserved to the user. As tasks are automatically reserved to the user when assignment occurs, this list will not display tasks except the ones that existed in this list from R1. Reserved Tasks The Reserved Tasks tab displays your processing team members' reserved tasks that are in Open and Deferred status. Note: This only applies to team leads. Note: By default, tasks are sorted by importance. User can re-sort as required using column headers. In the Inbox tab under a user's Tasks tab, tasks are segmented into 5 specific fields as described below: Table 2-Fields and Descriptions of Task Tab Fields Field Description Assigned Task The Assigned Tasks field is empty by default, unless there is a task listed under the Assigned Tasks category that is not specifically reserved for a particular staff member. In situations where the Assigned Tasks section is empty, the Make Available action will be disabled. All tasks will immediately be sent to Open Tasks and can be moved to Deferred Tasks . My Open Tasks The Open Tasks field displays the tasks split into 2 different sections. The Work Started field shows open tasks where the timer has been started by the team member, and the timer is still running. It only includes tasks where the most recent change type is Work Started and there is no Work Stopped change type after that. The Work Stopped / Work Not Started field displays open tasks where the timer has been stopped by the team member or tasks where the timer has not yet been started. It includes all open tasks for the team member, except for the ones displayed in the Work Started list. My Deferred Tasks The Deferred tasks field displays the tasks reserved to the team member where the task status is Deferred . Allocation Blocking History The Task Allocation Blocking History field provides a comprehensive list of the current, pending and expired allocation blocks. The supervisor can clear active or pending allocation blocks. The Allocation Blocking History page can be found under the Tasks tab in a user's workspace. My Users displays the name of your processing team members and the number of tasks that are reserved for or forwarded to the processing team member. You can also access your processing team member's workspace through My Users . You must be subscribed to a work queue to display the tasks that are in the work queue and to add or remove subscribers. To manage user-subscribed work queues and their associated tasks, you can navigate to the My Work Queues section under the My Users tab in the Shortcuts panel of the Teams and Workload tab. Note: Processing team members should only be subscribed to the manual work queues that correspond to their specific program (OAS or IO), business line (Processing, Citizen Services Branch, ISB, Call Centre) and region (ATL, QC, ON, WT, NHQ). Do not subscribe processing team members to any automated work queues. Once a processing team member is subscribed to a manual work queue, they have access to the tasks and can view them. Unsubscribing them from the manual work queue removes their access. Once subscribed to a manual work queue, a processing team member has the ability to reserve tasks to My Tasks list. The team lead can reserve a task directly from the work queue. H2 Exp-coll: Task statuses All tasks are categorized by 4 statuses: Open On Hold Deferred Completed Note: A task has an Open status when it is created. Tasks can be modified based on the task actions. This includes: Start Work: This task action moves a user's task from the Stopped Work / Work Not Started list to the Started Work list. Stop Work: This task action moves a user's task from the Started Work list to the Stopped Work / Work Not Started list. Add Comment : This task action allows a user to add comments to a task. Edit Task: This task action allows a user to update the category, type, skill type, and priority level of a task. Edit Due / Receipt Date: This task action allows a user to update the due date and receipt date of a task. Bring Forward: This task action allows a user to set the task to On Hold status until the bring forward date. This task will be allocated to the assigned work queue until the Bring Forward Date and will not show in the user's My Tasks list . Once the Bring Forward Date arrives, the system will set the task status back to Open . Make Available: This task action makes the task available to the previous assigned. The user will no longer see the task in their My Open Tasks list. Forward: This task action allows a user to forward a task assigned to them, to another user or work queue. Team leads can forward tasks that are not assigned to them. These tasks can be viewed in the Open Tasks page of the processing user's workspace or in the work queue workspace. Reallocate: This task action allows a user to remove the task from their inbox and re-run the allocation strategy that initially allocated the task at creation. Defer: This task action allows a user to set the task to Deferred status until the restart date. A task is deferred, and the task status is updated to Deferred . It will remain in the user's inbox and move into the My Deferred Tasks page. Restart: This task action allows a user to manually restart a deferred task and return it to the user's My Open Tasks list. Complete: This task action allows a user to update the status of a task to Completed . A task is completed and requires no further action. H2 Exp-coll: Distributing Tasks Note: The following process is only conducted by team leads. Tasks can be distributed to processing team members as follows: Table 3-Work Queue Subscription Situation Direction Subscribe to work queue Use the Subscribe to a Work Queue… function to assign yourself to a work queue.

H2 Exp-coll: Administrator Support There are a few key scenarios where administrator support is required in the Supervisor User Workspace. Firstly, when a team lead is attempting to forward more than 100 tasks in a single transaction, the team lead needs to contact an administrator to complete the batch process request. If you need the batch summary details after the batch is run, the administrator will provide the summary. A manual batch job is required to complete the forwarding of 100 or more tasks. You must submit a ticket to the National Service Desk Internal link to request the scheduling of a batch job. Tasks awaiting the batch job run cannot be manually forwarded. If you have 100 or more tasks that need to be forwarded and reviewed immediately, limit the number of tasks forwarded to 99 or less at a time to allow the forwarding to occur immediately. Secondly, when a team lead navigates to the My Users screen and it displays users that are not on their direct or indirect reporting or missing users, an administrator will need to update the organization unit and position for these users. Thirdly, when a user is added to the system, the user is assigned the following: an organization unit (e.g. ATL SDN Operations Call Centre Team 101) position (e.g. ATL SDN Operations Call Centre Team 10 Lead Position 01) language (English, French, Bilingual) An administrator manages this information from the Administrator Workspace. If a user changes organizations units, positions or acquires another language, an administrator must be contacted to update the user's profile.

H2 Exp-coll: Work queues Updated A work queue is a central repository that organizes, holds, and tracks the tasks that need to be completed within the system. Work queues are used to manage and monitor user-created or system-generated workload. There are 2 types of work queues: automatic work queues and manual work queues. Team members will only be subscribed to manual work queues. Team leads will be subscribed to both automatic and manual work queues to monitor workload, however, team leads will only subscribe team members to manual queues. Automatic work queues are used to hold tasks that can be automatically assigned by the system to users. Manual work queues are used to manage specific tasks that require manual intervention for allocation. A campaign work queue is a work queue created a result of an organization-planned activity or an event. It is organized with the purpose to complete an identified set of tasks by a specific group of staff members. Work queues have been configured specifically for OAS. In addition to automatic and manual work queue configurations, work queues are defined by region and purpose. Each region has a respective automatic and manual work queue Additionally, there are different work queues based on region (region or national), type of workload (migrated from legacy or generated in Cúram), and work queues by business units. Table 23-Types of Work Queues Type of work queue Description Work queue example National work queues Represents a work queue with tasks allocated irrespective of region. One-Workload-Processing One-Workload-PWS-Migrated Regional work queues Represents a work queue with tasks allocated respective of region.

It is only applicable once the documents have been scanned and verified in the Pensions Trusted Digital Repository (PTDR). What you need to know All incoming paper documents (including applications) must be scanned into the PTDR. Once the documents have been scanned into the PTDR, Cúram will upload them and display them in the Attachment tab under Contacts on the Person’s record. This will create one of 2 tasks that must be completed in Cúram: Table 1. Task and description for tasks created once an attachment is uploaded to Cúram Task name Description OAS Intake - Document Classification Match The incoming documentation is matched to an existing client profile in Cúram and the documentation must be reviewed. OAS Intake - Document Classification Non-Match The incoming documentation is not matched to an existing profile in Cúram. A person search must be performed and the documentation must be reviewed. Support clerks must modify the type of document that has been scanned and move it to the correct person or case record in Cúram. This automatically completes the OAS intake task and triggers the creation of a new task that must be completed by a support clerk or processing staff. The following applications will trigger a task for support clerks to add the application in Cúram: Application - ALW 3008 Application - ALW 3033 Application - ALWS 3008 Application - ALWS Blue Application - GIS NB 3025 Application - GIS NB 3025B Application - GIS Take up 3042 Application - GIS Take up 3043 Application - GIS Take up 3044 Application - OAS 3000 Application - OAS 5054 Application - OAS/GIS Integrated 3550 The following applications and documents will trigger a task that must be completed by processing officers : Application – GIS New Business 3018 Application – GIS New Business 3019 Application - OAS Conversion 3045 Application - Statement of Income for ALWS 3007 Application - Statement of Income for the GIS, ALW or ALWS 3026 Application - Statement of Estimated Income 3041 Application - Statement of Estimated Income VAR 3041 All other documents If the information in the application is sufficient, the client can be registered as a Person in Cúram. Any received information must be identified and applied to the Person’s profile. However, if there is insufficient information to create a Person, a Prospect Person is created to store any information that has been captured. Note: Once you add an application to Cúram, there may be a delay of up to 2 minutes before the application is created. Do not add the application again. Attachment destination You must determine why the document was provided and then move it to the appropriate location. If the document is: related to or in support of an application, it must be moved to the Application Case. related to a benefit already in pay, it must be moved to the Integrated Case. related to the individual and not specific to a benefit, keep the attachment on the Person’s record. In cases that support clerks are unsure where to move a document, it can reside on the Person’s record (e.g. paper application received and there is no Application Case) and the document can be moved later by processing staff, if required. Missing or incomplete information on an application When adding an application to Cúram, it may be determined that there is incomplete or missing information. In these cases, do not continue data capturing in the New Application Form wizard. You must edit the task's Skill Type for it to be reassigned to processing staff for them to request the missing information from the applicant. Online applications When a client submits an online application, the evidence types are automatically created in Cúram as the client has provided and identified the applicable information on their online application. This generates an Application Case in Cúram that contains all the information the client provided in their online application. Depending on the circumstances, a task is generated by Cúram that requires a processing officer to verify and activate the evidence to bring the Application Case to the authorization process. No action is required by support clerks for online applications. Top tab: Step by Step What you need to do OAS and International Operations In Cúram, click Inbox to view My Open Tasks .

What you need to know When a payment that was issued in Cúram is cancelled in the Standard Payment System (SPS), the status automatically changes from Issued to Cancelled , and the status for all instruction line items within the payment change from Processed to Cancelled . This will take 1 to 2 business days. These transactions can be found in the Financials tab at the Person level or in the Product Delivery Case. The SPS communicates both the successful and unsuccessful disbursement of payments back to Cúram, including the reasons for cancellations for traceability purposes. In some instances, you may cancel a payment in SPS before it is redeemed, and this cancellation is communicated to Cúram for further resolution. When a payment is cancelled, you must perform the Check eligibility function in Cúram before applying evidence changes. When a payment is cancelled, Cúram: identifies the non-reversible and reversible deductions: Table 1—Deduction types Deduction Type Employment Insurance Non-reversible CRA Set Off Non-reversible Veterans Affairs Canada Non-reversible Social Assistance Agency Reimbursement Non-reversible Department of Justice Arrears Non-reversible Department of Justice Fees Non-reversible Provincial Voluntary Tax Non-reversible Liability Offset Non-reversible Interest Reversible Penalties Reversible Departmental (Overpayments) Reversible Canada Pension Plan Reversible Non-Resident Tax Conditional OAS Recovery Tax Conditional Federal Voluntary Tax Conditional Note: Conditional deductions are processed as reversible or non-reversible based on the period the deduction was withheld and the date of the cancellation. A reversible deduction can become non-reversible if the cancellation is not in the same calendar year as the initial payment. creates a corresponding Overpayment Case for each non-reversible deduction regardless if the client's eligibility and entitlements during the cancelled payment period was reassessed or not and creates a corresponding deduction against each liability. reverses the reversible deductions and updates (increases) the liability amount back to amount that was reversed. reverses the reversible deductions and updates (decreases) the year-to-date totals by the amount that was reversed. records the cancellation reason for accountability and traceability purposes. updates the status of the payment from Issued to Cancelled . updates the status of any instruction line items from Processed to Cancelled . Updated Once Cúram receives a cancellation notice from the SPS, a task will be created to manage the cancelled payment. There are 2 possible paths you can choose for payment reissuance following a cancelled payment: reissuing payments; or reconciling and reissuing a payment. H2 Exp-coll: Reissuing payments Updated Updated You can reissue a cancelled payment to the original or an alternative nominee. The reissued payment is the same amount as the cancelled payment amount and will be picked up by the system and scheduled to go out for payment issuance as a priority payment. This will be done most often to reissue the payment to a different nominee (e.g. the payment went directly to the client but should have been issued to a third party or can be used to correct incorrect deductions when the payments are NIL or under treshold that do not have non-reversible deductions). Cúram checks if the payment includes any of the following deductions towards: Interest Penalties OAS overpayments Canada Pension Plan (cross program receivables) If any of these deductions are present, Cúram increases the Outstanding Balance Amount by the amount of the reversed deductions. Note: For interest, penalties and OAS overpayments, the deduction will be taken based on the amount withheld at the time of the original issuance, not at the time of reissuance. Where the outstanding debt is now zero, Cúram won't take a deduction. H2 Exp-coll: Reconciling and Reissuing a Payment Updated Updated The Reconcile &amp; Reissue Payment feature is only enabled for Cúram-generated payments, payments with pending Penalty, Interest, or Overpayment liabilities. The Reconcile &amp; Reissue Payment feature is not enabled for cancelled legacy payments and cancelled manual payments. It is used to be able to apply a cancelled payment to an outstanding overpayment, penalty, or interest either as a deduction or an internal reconciliation process. When submitted, the liability amount of the Overpayment, Interest, or Penalty will be reduced. Deductions will only be withheld if any amount is owing after the liability offset deduction and non-reversible deduction overpayments deductions have been applied. If any non-reversible deductions were withheld from the original payment, they will not be deducted a second time. Any reversible deductions (including 'Program Specific Overpayments', Penalties, Interests, CPP deductions) that were part of the original payment may be deducted again with any remaining amount after reconciliation should there still be an outstanding balance. Once you submit reconciling and reissuing a payment, Cúram does the following: It creates a Liability Offset deduction in the amount equal to the sum of the liability offset amounts. When the payment is reissued, Cúram will end-date the liability offset deduction and its status will be changed to Inactive . It reduces the liability amount of the overpayment, interest, or penalty. For overpayments, a write-off is created; for a penalty or interest, the outstanding balance amount is reduced. The reissued payment will be picked-up by the Standard Payment System batch process for further processing if the remaining balance after reconciliation is greater than $1.00. H2 Exp-coll: Payment cancelled after reassessment or the payment included an underpayment If the payment is cancelled after reassessment, you must determine if the cancelled payment should be applied to any existing overpayment. If yes, you must use the Reconcile &amp; Reissue functionality. If no, reissue the payment. H2 Exp-coll: Cancelling Nil or under threshold payments New You can manually cancel a payment record in Cúram if it is within your delegation of authority in the following situations: the payment is created after an Eligibility and Entitlement re-assessment occurs and there is no longer entitlement to that payment; to correct the payment if an incorrect deduction was applied, rather than manually reversing the deduction and paying as a priority payment. The manual cancellation function can be used under the following conditions: The net payment amount is $0.00 ( Nil Payment ); or The net payment is under the $1 threshold ( UT ) and remains in that status, indicating it has not yet been included in a subsequent payment. If you cancel a payment that includes a reversible deduction, you must apply the gross entitlement to the overpayment to void the overpayment to $0.00. If you cancel a payment that included a non-reversible deduction, the amount available to offset should already be reduced by the amount of the non-reversible deduction which would leave an outstanding overpayment equal to the amount of the non-reversible deduction. Top tab: Step by Step What you need to do H2 Exp-coll: Cancel Nil or under threshold payments New In Cúram, go to client's profile. Refer to Search for a Person in Cúram (Action) . Click the Financials tab. Click the Transactions tab in the page group navigation bar on the left. The Transactions page opens. A list of payments can be viewed here.

Click the ( &gt; ) toggle icon next to the payment with a status of Nil Payment or UT to view the deduction source and if the deduction is a non-reversible or reversible deduction. Note: If a payment falls below the minimum threshold of $1.00, Cúram will not issue it immediately. If subsequent payments are made and the combined total exceeds the $1.00 threshold, Cúram will automatically issue the previously withheld underpayment. Once this occurs, you can no longer manually cancel the payment; you must follow the regular cancellation process. Click the 3-dots ( … ) action menu to the right of the payment to be cancelled and select Cancel Payment . The Cancel Payment window opens. Select Issued in error from the Reason drop-down menu.

What you need to know PSCD creates interest automatically on liabilities when penalties are imposed on a client. When this happens, PSCD issues a report requiring you to create or modify an interest record on a client's penalty liability or overpayment case. Interest is a liability owed by a client to the Department. It is a separate liability from a penalty liability or overpayment that the interest is owed on. Interest can only be charged if a penalty is imposed, even if the amount imposed is 0. The amount of interest charged will be based on many factors including the collection status, the amount of the penalty and/or any associated overpayments. Liabilities, including interest records, can only be deleted in the pre-payment period which occurs before gross to net has been calculated.

The Department uses special caution(s) to alert staff of the issues and concerns. A red exclamation mark in the top-left of the Profile Home Screen identifies a person with a special caution. Special cautions do not stop processing on a client account. All processes currently in place with the client should proceed while special cautions are present on a client account. A special caution indicates the Department needs to pay attention to the account to ensure correct business processes are followed. A client can have more than one special caution applied to their profile. For example, if the client has a risk of inaccurate migrated data and their whereabouts are unknown. Special cautions may be added in the following instances: Special Caution Type Description Whereabouts Unknown An Employment and Social Development Canada Department representative can create a Whereabouts Unknown special caution when the client cannot be located. Based on the established procedures, once certain duration has elapsed and the client still cannot be located, the client may be referred to the Integrity Services Branch (ISB) for investigation and another special caution can be created to capture Under Investigation with ISB . If the ISB is not able to locate the client, you must leave the flag on the account even after the investigation has been concluded. Under Appeal A Department representative can create an Under Appeal special caution to indicate that the client has submitted an appeal to Social Security Tribunal (SST). Under Reconsideration A Department representative can create an Under Reconsideration special caution to indicate that a paper-based Request for Reconsideration document was uploaded for a client. Additional Security Criteria When the ISB has identified that a specific client requires additional security criteria for authentication, an Additional Security Criteria flag can be set and maintained for the Client. Risk of Inaccurate Migrated Data The migration process has identified that some clients may have inaccurate data migrated from the pay pattern file. Under Investigation with ISB A Department representative has referred the client to the ISB for investigation and captures the flag for the client. Note: Specific pay pattern error codes will indicate that it is necessary to apply a special caution of the type Risk of Inaccurate Migrated Data . These error codes do not exist in Cúram currently. Note: Do not add a special caution flag if the account has Reconsideration In Progress written in red in the context panel. The Under Consideration special caution flag is only necessary when a paper-based request for reconsideration has been uploaded for a client, but the request for reconsideration has not yet been added to the client account. The Under Reconsideration special caution flag must be removed as soon as the request for reconsideration has been added to the account. Refer to Manage Requests for Reconsideration in Cúram (Action) . Special cautions should be removed in the following situations: The Department has located a client whose location was previously not known. The ISB has concluded their investigation. The Under ISB Investigation flag can only be removed by a SCBO and only after the adjustments have been applied. The client's appeal to the SST has been finalized. All paper-based reconsideration documents for the client have been captured in Cúram and all the client's reconsideration requests have been resolved. The ISB has determined that the additional security criteria is no longer required on the client's account. Additional security criteria can be added by other channels as well in addition to ISB. All inaccurate migrated data previously identified in the client's record has been resolved. All special cautions that have been removed will be display in the Previous tab of the Special Cautions tab. Note: Only delete a special caution on a person record in one of the following situations: The special caution is placed in the wrong record. The wrong type of special caution was placed in the record. The special caution was placed with the wrong date.

What you need to know In Cúram, foreign creditable periods are entered as either foreign contribution period or foreign residence period evidence on a Foreign Engagement Case. The number of entries you can make is unlimited and gaps are allowable between creditable periods. Foreign creditable periods are added to the Canadian residence calculated from the Integrated Case to help the client meet the minimum Canadian residence requirements to receive OAS benefits. OAS pension entitlement is still calculated based on actual years of Canadian residence. Refer to Validate Residence (Scenario) for additional information. If a Canadian residence period in the Application Case overlaps with a foreign residence period on the FEC, an issue will be raised on the Evidence Dashboard . If a Canadian residence period in the Integrated Case or a Foreign residence period on the FEC is modified, and an overlap is created, a warning message is displayed. This must be resolved before the evidence can be activated. Refer to Resolve Issues for Foreign Contribution and Canadian Residence Periods in Cúram (Action) . If exact dates are not available, foreign periods must be recorded in unstructured foreign contribution period or unstructured foreign residence period evidence. These evidences are used to capture a client's description of their foreign creditable periods that are received without start and end dates. These evidences are not used by Cúram in determining eligibility or entitlement. If an application must be adjudicated manually for OAS Benefits with unstructured creditable periods, overrides must be leveraged. Refer to Eligibility and Entitlement Override Evidence—Add, Edit, View, and Delete in Cúram (Action) .

What you need to know Note: Any Year to Date values for cancelled legacy payments issued between January and March 2025 that are subsequently cancelled in 2025 cannot be modified in Cúram. You must adjust them using temporary screens in ITRDS . Payments are issued, returned, and cancelled through the Standard Payment System (SPS) on behalf of the government of Canada. When a payment is cancelled in SPS, Cúram will receive a cancelled payment file and create a task to review the cancelled legacy payment. Unlike Cúram-issued cancelled payments, when the payment is issued before migration to Cúram, it cannot be resolved systematically. OAS clients from the OAS Online and IA legacy systems will be migrated into Cúram. For clients migrating from OAS Online, Cúram generates a lump sum legacy payment of all the client’s historical entitlements during the cutover process. The legacy payment is based on the first eligibility and entitlement reassessment upon the migration of historical evidence. Historical eligibility and entitlement information from 2010 onwards will be migrated. During migration, the following items will be created: an OAS Integrated Case; a Product Delivery Case; financial components; and a payment record based on the created financial components. For clients migrating from the IA system, no historical entitlement data will be migrated for IA clients and no financial information will be generated for periods prior to migration. This means that Cúram will assume that it has not paid any amount to the client. During migration, the following items will be created: an OAS Integrated Case; a Product Delivery Case; and current financial components including entitlements, deductions and payment Information OAS/IA YTD Adjustment ( ITRDS screen) The OAS/IA YTD Adjustment ITRDS screen is a tool used to record and manage year-to-date (YTD) adjustments for OAS and IA payments. It was created to: record the YTDs for entitlements and deductions for OAS legacy payments that were determined prior to migration and will not or may not be reissued in 2025. These payments include those cancelled from January to March 2025. The legacy cancelled payments are not recognized by Cúram. These could be payments issued or not (e.g. no payment due to full recovery). provide the ability to manage these values due to cancelled payments. For more information, refer to Modify OAS-IA legacy system's Year-To-Date (YTD) for January to March 2025 Internal link . When a legacy payment is cancelled, you must determine if any liabilities and/or deductions were included in the legacy payments. If reversible deductions were included, they must be reversed in Cúram. If these liabilities/deductions still exist on reissuance, you must apply them as deductions when re-issuing the payment. If there are non-reversible liabilities/deductions, the amount of non-reversible deductions must be taken into consideration on reissuance of the payment. The following table will help guide you through the possible scenarios and the steps for managing these cancelled payments: Table 1 — OAS Online Cancelled Payment Manual Intervention Scenarios Scenario Direction The client is entitled to a cancelled payment, and there is no change in client circumstances.

This can involve actions such as create, modify, delete, amend, issue, cancel, and reverse cancellation of T4 or NR4 tax slip. What you need to know There are 3 types of tax slips: Table 1. Types of tax slips and their description Tax slip Description T4A (OAS) This tax slip is generated for clients who received any payment in Canada or to deemed residents. NR4 (OAS) This tax slip is generated for clients who received any OAS pension payment outside of Canada. This will show up as NR4 OAS form. NR4 (OAS) (ITB) This tax slip is generated for clients who received any income-tested benefits payments outside of Canada. This will show up as an NR4 OAS form. Note: A client may receive both an NR4 (OAS) and NR4 (ITB) NR4 if applicable. Tax slips are categorized as Original , Amended , or Cancelled , and their progress can be tracked through different issuance statuses such as Submitted , Issued , Draft and Deleted . Table 2. Tax slip categories Tax Slip Category Description Original This is the original state that a specific type and year of tax slip (i.e. T4A(OAS), 2023) was generated in for a given client. Amended Amended tax slips indicates changes made to the financial data generated for a specific client, tax slip form type, and tax year after the tax slip has been issued. If you are only reissuing a tax slip to a new address or authorized person, you should not be issuing an amended tax slip, rather you should issue a duplicate tax slip. Cancelled If you see the “Cancelled” category on a tax slip, this means that a tax slip was cancelled due to not having valid data or it was issued in error. New Note: When issuing a tax slip after an address change, the old address will still appear on the duplicate request in Cúram. The system will automatically send the duplicate to the new address on file. Table 3. Tax Slip Issuance Status Tax Slip Issuance Status Description Submitted This status indicates that tax slip data has been generated but has not yet been processed or released. This status indicates that the tax slip is ready to be picked up for processing by the CRA/MRQ (Canada Revenue Agency / Ministry of Revenue Quebec) interface batch jobs and print batch. Issued The tax slip has been processed or released to CRA/MRQ and to printing or Universal Access. This issuance status is not picked by the CRA/MRQ batch for processing. No further changes can be made to this version of the tax slip. It  can only be amended or cancelled or issued (duplicate). Draft Tax slip data has been generated but is not yet ready to be processed or released. The tax slip should not be picked up for processing by the tax slip interface batch jobs. Deleted The tax slip version has been logically deleted. Deleted tax slip versions will no longer be visible. Note: If a duplicate has been created, the issuance status will show up with (duplicate) (e.g. Issued (Duplicate) ) You can view and modify the tax slips through several action items: Table 4. Action Items Action Item Description Duplicate and Issue The Duplicate and Issue action allows you to reissue a tax slip to the client. This can only happen if the financial data has not changed. Create The Create action allows you to start a new tax slip after one has been deleted or cancelled. When you select the Create action, the Create Tax Slip wizard opens. This is only available when the issuance status is Deleted or Cancelled , and can only be created for a tax year after the last business day of that tax year, and no tax slips already exists for that year. This does not include actions on deceased clients, which may be performed at any time. Edit The Edit action allows you to modify an existing tax slip. When you select the Edit action, the Edit Tax Slip wizard opens. Delete The Delete action allows you to remove a tax slip that is not in its final state. When you select the Delete action, a confirmation dialog box opens. Amend The Amend action allows you to make changes to a tax slip that has been officially issued. When you select the Amend action, the Amend Tax Slip wizard opens. This is only used when financial data needs to be changed. Cancel The Cancel action allows you to invalidate a tax slip that has been issued but needs to be cancelled. When you select the Cancel action, a Cancel Tax Slip wizard opens. The cancellation of OAS tax slips is a new functionality with the migration to Cúram. Note: Agents should use E-forms for all T4 and NR4 creation, amendment, or duplicate requests for years 2022 and prior.

What you need to know Mismatches on the case record occur when there are discrepancies between the information stored in Cúram and ITRDS . These mismatches can happen for any information in the case record (e.g. bank account details, phone records, third-party contact evidence for representatives). If there is an error in matching data, the system sends an error response code. Subsequently, the error code may generate a task in Cúram. This information will assist you to validate mismatched case records with ITRDS . The following are examples of mismatch tasks: Example 1: Mismatched bank account details A mismatch may occur when a future-dated bank account exists for a client in Cúram and the system receives an event update from ITRDS . The client account will need to be reviewed when there is a transactional event update from ITRDS to delete future-dated bank account or if there is a mismatch with existing future-dated bank account (i.e. financial institution number, branch transit number and account number). You must review the client's account information before manually closing the task. Example 2: Mismatched phone records There may be a mismatch when the system cannot match an existing current or future-dated phone record in Cúram with a transactional event update from ITRDS to delete phone record. A mismatch task would be created when the matching criteria (i.e. type, start date, phone number) do not match between Cúram and the ITRDS update. Based on this review you must decide whether to add, modify or delete the correct phone number to resolve the mismatch. Table 1 — Cúram to ITRDS Telephone mapping Cúram ITRDS Personal Landline 1 – Home Personal Mobile 3 – Cell Business Landline 2 – Business Personal Teletypewriter (TTY) 7 – Device for the Deaf Business Mobile 8 – Other Business Teletypewriter 8 – Other Example 3: Mismatched third-party representative evidence When Cúram cannot match a third-party representative evidence record with the transactional event update from ITRDS , a task will be created to update the third-party contact information. You must review and update the relevant contact details to ensure the case record is accurate. Note that only the representative role is shared between Cúram and ITRDS . No other third-party representative role is shared or can be mismatched. However, it is possible to have 2 separate third party contacts for a single client in Cúram (i.e. Trustee and Power of Attorney). Also, there are no mismatch tasks surrounding Third Party Contacts between ITRDS and Cúram. A mismatch on this would likely be a system-based mismatch because Cúram was not sending the correct or enough information for ITRDS to retrieve the correct record. Example 4: Mismatched future-dated addresses A mismatch for future-dated addresses may occur when an ITRDS update is received but there is a difference in the effective date of the address change or there are multiple future-dated addresses. The client account must be reviewed, and information must be evaluated to determine if ITRDS updates must be applied or identify the correct future-dated address to be deleted. Example 5: Mismatched death match If there is a mismatch of date of death with ITRDS or if there's no date of death in Cúram, the date of death must be reviewed. The date of death evidence record on the person profile must be updated based on the event update from ITRDS . Example 6: Mismatched marital status A CRA Marital Status Mismatch task is created for verification when a mismatch with CRA Marital Status and Marital Relationship evidence do not match. If Cúram receives marital status information from the CRA and the details do not match with the existing CRA marital status evidence in the client’s profile, Cúram will update the CRA marital status evidence with the new details from the CRA. Top tab: Step by Step What you need to do Review the mismatch task In Cúram, click the Inbox tab. Click the Shortcuts panel on the left. Click My Tasks under Tasks. Click the Task hyperlinkunder Work Stopped / Work Not Started. The homepage of the task opens. Review the task information available within the Task window.

What you need to know There are 3 International Social Security Agreement (ISSA) countries (United States, Japan, and Jamaica) with information sharing restriction that do not allow any information, including the date of death that is received on a Foreign Liaison form to be shared outside of International Operations (IO). Refer to International Operations — Sharing information obtained under an International Social Security Agreement (Knowledge) for more information if needed. Due to the restrictions that do not allow the information to be shared outside of IO, this evidence is to be created on the Foreign Engagement Case (FEC) so that the date of death received remains restricted. Once the evidence is created on the FEC, it only applies to Canadian benefits processed under an ISSA. If the date of death is reported or verified by a non-restricted source in the future (e.g. confirmed or reported by NOK, death certificate, or other) the date of death can then be updated on the person record. Before entering a date of death on the Restricted FEC, you must verify that a date of death is not already recorded on the person. If the date of death on the person and the date of death on the liaison is different, you must verify the date of death prior to entering the date of death on the Restricted FEC. Cúram does not restrict you from adding a date of death on the Person’s profile and on the FEC. If a “Birth or Death details” evidence or “Restricted Date of Death” evidence is activated and date of death on the 2 evidence does not match, then a task will be generated to review the date of death. This task will be sent to the IO User as they have access to both the Person level Date of Death and the Restricted Date of Death. Different dates of death received from restricted countries Different dates of death may be received from restricted countries. In such cases, only the correct date of death must be captured in the system as evidence. If any previously captured date is incorrect, the evidence must be deleted, and a new restricted date of death evidence should be created. For example, you initially capture and activate the first received restricted date of death evidence. Later, the department receives another restricted date of death from one of the other two restricted countries. If the date matches the previously captured one, no further action is needed. However, if the date differs, you must conduct research to determine the correct date of death. If the previously captured date is confirmed to be correct, no further steps are required. If the new date is determined as correct, you must delete the existing Restricted Date of Death evidence and apply changes. After applying changes, you must capture the new ‘Restricted Date of Death’ evidence with the correct date of death and apply changes.

What you need to know Every month, Cúram will: identify clients who need a conversion record; create this record; and set an automated conversion status based on certain criteria. These actions are performed by the system; no action is required for this creation to occur. At the start of every month, the system will create a task to be reviewed if: the client will turn 64+9 months or 65; and the client's Automated Conversion status is set to No ; and the client's Conversion Status is set to Pending . Once a conversion record has been created, it will be available on the ALW / ALWS conversion page. Note: At 64+9 months, the client's automated conversion status may be set to No because they have less than 40 years of residence in Canada on their ALW / ALWS benefit approval date, or because they are eligible but not entitled (or entitled to $0) for the ALW or ALWS benefit. Note: At the beginning of the month the client turns 65, their automated conversion status may be set to No because they are eligible but not entitled (or entitled to $0) for the ALW or ALWS benefit. Therefore, a task will be created at this time if the client has lost their entitlement between 64+9 months and 65. A new ALW / ALWS Conversion page will appear on the Administration tab of the client's Integrated Case only once a conversion record has been created by the system. Note: If a client already has OAS Pension Application Details with Auto-Enrolment as the method of application, they will move from ALW / ALWS to OAS/GIS through Auto-Enrolment rather than through the conversion process. H2 Exp-coll: Conversion for clients with 40ths When converting clients, identify their current number of 40ths by reviewing the 40th override. on the Integrated Case. Based on the number of 40ths, follow the procedures below in addition to the standard conversion procedures. For more information, refer to Eligibility and Entitlement Override Evidence—Add, Edit, View, and Delete in Cúram (Action) . H2 Exp-coll: Conversion for Clients with 40ths override equal to 40 You do not have to modify any overrides. At the time of conversion (i.e. the end of the month where the Client turns 65), the following will occur: The System will create Is Eligible Override for the OAS Pension and GIS, with a start date of the month after the Client turns 65. The System will create the Is Entitled override for the OAS Pension and GIS, with a start date of the month after the Client turns 65. The System will create an Actuarially Adjusted Months override with a value of 0, to comply with system rules that a 40ths override must always be accompanied by an Actuarially Adjusted Months Override. H2 Exp-coll: Conversion for Clients with 40ths override less than 40 At the time of conversion (i.e. the end of the month where the Client turns 65), the following will occur: The System will create Is Eligible Override for the OAS Pension and GIS, with a start date of the month after the Client turns 65. The System will create the Is Entitled override for the OAS Pension and GIS, with a start date of the month after the Client turns 65. However, you must also: add the residence period evidence since the age of 18 (with the combination of information provided in the initial ALW or ALWS benefit application and the Conversion Application (OAS/GIS) (ISP-3045) form; and delete the 40ths override. This will allow Cúram to automatically calculate the number of 40ths for the OAS pension and the GIS and facilitate long-term maintenance of the account in case of future recalculations. H2 Exp-coll: Clients suspended prior to migration New If a migrated account is only suspended due to their income being over the threshold, you must add an Is Entitled override for the ALW or ALWS benefit based on the benefit type the client is currently eligible for. The Start Date and End Date of this override should match the Start Date and End Date of the Is Eligible override on the OAS case. At the time of conversion, this will allow the system to convert the Is Entitled to the ALW or ALWS benefit override to the Is Entitled to OAS Pension and Is Entitled to GIS, allowing for entitlement to be paid for the OAS Pension, and for GIS when the client’s income is reduced to below the income threshold.

What you need to know You can create a GIS application from a Person page or Prospect Person page. You can add a GIS application form with the information found in the Application for Guaranteed Income Supplement (ISP-3025-Internal, ISP-3025-External, ISP-3025B, ISP-3042, ISP-3043, ISP-3044). After you submit the application form, an Application Case link will be automatically created under the Cases and Applications tab. Refer to OAS/GIS Application Case—View, Authorize, Reopen and Print in Cúram (Action) . You can view the GIS application for more information associated with a client's application before starting the authorizing. An incomplete application can be submitted so that an Application Case is created to generate correspondence from the Application Case. You will manually send the correspondence associated with the tasks based on the information required to process the application. When there's an application with a spouse or common-law partner, it is necessary to capture their consent. If consent has already been provided on a previous application, it can be carried over to the new application. If no prior consent exists, new consent must be obtained before proceeding. The declaration information can be found in the Consent and Declaration evidence under the Evidence tab of the Application Case. You cannot delete a GIS Application Case. However, a client can request to cease the GIS. A client can also request to opt-out of auto enrolment of the GIS. If a client's OAS application was approved before the cutover (i.e. before March 1, 2025) but their GIS application was not, you must submit a standalone “Application for Guaranteed Income Supplement” to authorize the GIS. However, if you submit a new “Application for Old Age Security Pension and Guaranteed Income Supplement” instead, you must proceed with completing all necessary case work in the Application Case, including adding evidences, completing verifications, and resolving any outstanding tasks. The OAS benefit should then be authorized. Cúram will copy the relevant evidence to the migrated Integrated Case. You must then review the Integrated Case to ensure all evidence has been carried over to the Integrated Case and determine whether any overrides need to be updated or removed based on the information available. You can now authorize the GIS. Note: Authorizing the OAS pension will not generate a duplicate benefit, as Cúram maintains only one Integrated Case and one Product Delivery Case. New Note: An override should not be removed unless the entire residence history is updated based on information on file. You must add the full residence history that was submitted on the OAS application before authorizing the GIS, then an override can be removed. Refer to Special Qualifying Factor (Work Tool) .

What you need to know An OAS / GIS Application Case is automatically created during the auto-enrolment process and a separate OAS / GIS Application Case is created for the GIS auto-enrolment process. The evidence required to support each auto-enrolment process is also created automatically. An OAS / GIS Application Case can be accessed from the person's profile. Refer to OAS/ GIS Application Case—View, Authorize, Reopen and Print in Cúram (Action) . You can view a client’s OAS and GIS auto-enrolment status on the automatic enrolment screen that is accessed from the OAS / GIS Application Case. The auto-enrolment screen is only accessible from the Application Case for clients that are auto enrolled. The link will not display if a client is not auto enrolled. The Automatic Enrolment screen displays the OAS auto-enrolment status and GIS auto-enrolment status, current and historical, so that you can see where the client is in each auto-enrolment process. You can also manually update either auto-enrolment status from the screen. The OAS / GIS Application Case created by each auto-enrolment process is automatically authorized at the beginning of the month that the client turns 65 years old. The auto-enrolment authorization process will send the entitlement award letter (ISP-3092) automatically. Note: After each OAS / GIS Application Case is authorized, the auto-enrolment process is considered complete. A client may be excluded from the auto-enrolment process automatically if an issue (e.g. evidence issue) is encountered, or if certain information changes (e.g. date of birth month or year changes) during automatic enrolment. You can also exclude a client from auto-enrolment manually if needed using the Edit OAS auto-enrolment status or GIS auto-enrolment status process. Updated A client may decide to opt out of auto-enrolment before the authorization process. You can see if a client has opted out by checking the status on the Application Details evidence. If a client has opted out via Client Portal, there are no steps required for processing until an application is received. If the client opts out via a letter, you will need to make this update before the month the client turns 65 to reflect the client has opted out of auto-enrolment. Identity Confirmed When a client is selected for OAS auto-enrolment or GIS auto-enrolment, their identity is confirmed and verified in ITRDS /EDB before the auto-enrolment process starts in Cúram. As a result, a client that is auto-enrolment for OAS or GIS is considered verified so none of the evidence requires verification during auto-enrolment. Any changes to the evidence (e.g. manually or a life event) will trigger a verification, if applicable, as per the standard process. Manual Intervention If a client’s auto-enrolment status is set to Manual Intervention , manually or automatically, then the remaining steps of the auto-enrolment process must be completed manually up until authorization. When doing this, set the client’s auto-enrolment status to Waiting for Authorization as the last step in the process. After this, the auto-enrolment authorization process will complete the process. You must generate correspondence manually for all the steps you complete during manual intervention. Top tab: Step by Step What you need to do H2 Exp-coll: View OAS and GIS automatic enrolment details In Cúram, go to the person's profile. Refer to Search for a Person in Cúram (Action) .

GIS AE Exclusion Reason The reason that the client is excluded from GIS auto-enrolment. This field only displays when the status is Excluded . Auto-Enrolment Status History Cluster Header Pension Identifies which pension or benefit the status record is related to. AE Status The status that was in effect based on the effective date and time. Effective Date Time The date and time that the auto-enrolment status came into effect. Updated By The system or individual that updated the status. If the status was updated manually, the username will be displayed. Table 2 — Automatic Enrolment Statuses Status Description Ready for Intake Only used by OAS auto-enrolment to indicate that the client is ready to be picked up by the OAS auto-enrolment intake process. This is the first step in the OAS auto-enrolment process after the file has been received. Intake in progress Only used by OAS auto-enrolment to indicate that the OAS auto-enrolment intake process has started for the client. The intake process is used to match or register a client as a Person in Cúram, create the application case, and create the evidence on the application case. Ready for GIS AE Only used by GIS auto-enrolment to indicate that the client is ready to be auto enrolled. This is the first step in the GIS auto-enrolment process after the GIS auto-enrolment file is received. GIS AE Initiated Only used by GIS auto-enrolment to indicate that the GIS auto-enrolment process has been initiated for the client. During this step there is a check to confirm the client is still auto enrolled for OAS, and to ensure the client has not already applied for GIS (e.g. a paper application). Add to lifetime list Only used by GIS auto-enrolment to indicate that the client has been added to the CRA lifetime list. The status remains at this status until the CRA has provided a response with the client’s income information. This step is skipped if the client is already on the CRA lifetime list. Validate CRA response Only used by GIS auto-enrolment to check the response from the CRA (income information), and validate the information provided. Validation includes steps such as checking that income information was provided successfully for the tax year, death code, bankruptcy status, and marital status. Check for Spouse Only used by GIS auto-enrolment to check if the client has a spouse, based on the response from the CRA, and to compare it with the Marital status in Cúram. If the client has a spouse, then the system checks if the spouse is already in Cúram. During this stage, the status may be set to Manual Intervention if the system finds the spouse in Cúram but is not able to create marital relationship evidence automatically. Request Spouse profile Only used by GIS auto-enrolment to retrieve the spousal information from ITRDS /EDB if the spouse is not found in Cúram. During this stage, the status may be set to Manual Intervention if the system encounters an error when attempting to send the spousal information from ITRDS /EDB to Cúram. Spouse profile received Only used by GIS auto-enrolment to indicate that the spousal information was received from ITRDS /EDB. Spouse Added to Application Only used by GIS auto-enrolment to indicate that the client’s spouse was successfully added to the Application Case and the marital relationship evidence was created successfully. Add Spouse to lifetime list Only used by GIS auto-enrolment when the spouse is added to the CRA lifetime list to receive their income information from the CRA. This step is skipped if the spouse is already on the CRA lifetime list. Validate Spouse CRA response Only used by GIS auto-enrolment to check the response from the CRA (income information), and validate the information provided. Validation includes steps such as checking that income information was provided successfully for the tax year, bankruptcy status, and death code. Manual Intervention Used by OAS auto-enrolment and GIS auto-enrolment to indicate that the remaining auto-enrolment steps need to be completed manually. Once all the remaining steps are completed, including sending correspondence manually, then the status should be set to Waiting for Authorization . The authorization process should not be done manually. Setting the status to Waiting for Authorization will ensure that the authorization process will complete the process in the month that the client turns 65. Waiting for authorization Used by OAS auto-enrolment and GIS auto-enrolment to indicate that the client has almost completed all the auto-enrolment steps. The only remaining step is the authorization process, which occurs at the beginning of the month that the client turns 65 years old. Auto Enrolled Used by OAS auto-enrolment and GIS auto-enrolment to indicate that the client has been successfully auto enrolled. This is the last step of the auto-enrolment process after the Application Case has been authorized. Excluded Used by OAS auto-enrolment and GIS auto-enrolment to indicate that the client has been excluded from the OAS or GIS auto-enrolment process.

What you need to know Bank account information contains the details of a client's bank accounts. Bank accounts can be used to set up electronic fund transfers to or from the Department. Updated New direct deposit information for all clients must be recorded as a Joint Account and the Account Name must be entered as or changed to alphabetical characters that reflect the clients' name. New You must use the following formatting for the Account Name field for joint accounts: New Use the first letter of the client’s first name, followed by a space and their full last name. Then, use the word "and", followed by the first letter of the linked client’s first name, a space, and their full last name. Example E Bennet and F Darcy New Note: Do not enter a period after the first letter of the clients' first name and ensure there is a space between the first initial and the last name. New If a middle name is provided, it can be abbreviated to an initial and placed between the first initial and the last name, separated by spaces. Example E J Bennet and F Darcy New The Account Name field in Cúram has a character limit of 60. However, when sharing the new direct deposit information with CPP, the Account Name entered in Cúram must be limited to 30 characters to comply with Account Holder name input requirements for ITRDS . New For joint accounts exceeding this limit only , you must follow the instructions below: New In Cúram: Update the direct deposit information for OAS, ensuring the above account name formatting is followed. Do not check the Use for CPP checkbox. New In ITRDS , provide detailed notes indicating that due to character limits, the direct deposit was only updated in Cúram. New Fill out the Communication between programs (ISP-0435) form, noting that the direct deposit information has been updated for OAS and requires review by CPP. Refer to Communication Between Programs (ISP-0435) Form (Action) . Joint accounts As Cúram does not allow more than one client to receive pension payments in the same bank account unless the Bank Accounts Details are the same across these clients, you will receive an error message when you try to update or add bank account details if the information does not match. If you receive this error message, you must review the account to determine if the client has a spouse, common-law partner or a third party registered in Cúram. If this spouse, common-law partner or third party is receiving payments in the same account, their Bank Accounts evidence must be updated to match. When a payment has not been processed, refer to the Payments not issued section in the What you need to do section of the Step by Step tab. When a payment has been processed, the direct deposit information must not be edited for evidence preservation purposes. Refer to the Payments Issued section in the What you need to do section of the Step by Step tab. If the client has no spouse, or there is no third-party evidence recorded on the account, you must call the client to obtain information about the party who may be using the identical bank account. If you are unable to determine who may be using the same banking information as the client, send an enquiry via the NEXO Tool Internal link . Note: Do not disclose to the client that this bank account is already in use by another beneficiary. Instead, ask if the bank account the client submitted is for a joint account. If a task was received from the Call Centre with a request to update the direct deposit information, review the date of the request then intercept and redirect pending payments, as needed, to avoid returned payments. Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) receives data from Canadian financial institutions regarding changes to a client’s direct deposit information. Once PSPC verifies the Standard Payment System and performs updates, they will then create a Notice of Change File which is sent to the Department. When the Notice of Change is received from PSPC to update direct deposit information, Cúram attempts to automatically update the direct deposit information for clients. If Cúram is unable to automatically update the direct deposit information based on the Notice of Change, a task will be generated. You must review the client's information and manually add the direct deposit information. This will ensure that payment goes to the correct bank account.

What you need to know The renewal of income-tested benefits is an annual process that occurs in July, which is the start of a new benefit payment period. If a client is eligible for an income-tested benefit and their income information from the previous calendar year has been received, Cúram will automatically process the renewal of the benefit. In addition to the renewal of benefits, several supporting activities are performed around the same time in Cúram. These activities include: reviewing existing overrides; sending appropriate correspondence (e.g. renewal notices, decision letters); reviewing income variances that may indicate inconsistencies between reported and actual income; and reconciling estimated income that was used for the prior benefit period with the actual income now received. Some clients may need to fill out a Statement of Income for the Guaranteed Income Supplement, the Allowance or Allowance for the Survivor for payment period of July (20XX) to June (20XX) with Information Sheet (ISP-3026) form to keep receiving their benefits. This usually happens when their income information is missing, because they have not filed a tax return, or they don't meet the eligibility rules for automatic renewal based on the information available (e.g. there is a bankruptcy reported by the CRA ). The ISP-3026 form is mailed in March to the address the client has on file at the end of the March accounting month. If the ISP-3026 form is not returned by late June, Cúram automatically sends a second form. If the ISP-3026 form is still not returned in time, benefit payments may be delayed starting in July. Before income-tested benefits are paid for the new payment period, Cúram goes through a process called "reversion", which takes place in June. This process includes: moving all new income information into the current income fields; deleting any data that is no longer needed from the previous payment period; calculating eligibility for the GIS, the ALW benefit, and the ALWS benefit based on the updated income; and capturing information for issuing entitlement correspondence. As part of the supporting activities during the renewal process, Cúram will automatically generate tasks based on pre-defined trigger conditions. These tasks are applied to the client profile which are assigned to processing agents to review and resolve. Below is a list of tasks that Cúram generates along with their associated trigger conditions: Situation Task Subject Task Type Client's total payment income for the June accounting month is $0; No base income for the most recent calendar year. &lt;SIN or Curam Reference Number&gt; - &lt;First Name&gt; &lt; Last Name&gt; - No renewal received and income was nil for the previous payment period. Renewal Follow-up - Income A bulk reassessment is triggered and the reassessment of eligibility does not complete successfully. &lt;SIN or Curam reference number&gt; - &lt;First name&gt; &lt;Last Name&gt; - The re-assessment of eligibility for &lt;Case Type&gt; &lt;Case Reference Number&gt; did not complete successfully. Review case and resolve. Renewal Reassessment Incomplete The CRA indicates the Client reported pre/post bankruptcy. Pre/Post bankruptcy reported for Person &lt;Matched Person Member ID&gt; CRA – GIS Take-Up CRA – Assessment and Reassessment The CRA indicates that the Client is deceased. CRA Reported Date of Death for Person &lt;Matched Person member ID&gt; CRA – Assessment and Reassessment The CPP/QPP Pre-match value is greater than pre-match. Declared CPP/QPP amount is above CRA Amount for &lt;Tax Year&gt; CRA – Income Validation(s) Total amount exceeds the year over year threshold between the provided tax year and the prior tax year. Year over year income variance threshold exceeded for &lt;Tax Year&gt; CRA – Income Validation(s) The total OAS Program Benefit Amount issued to the Client for the tax year equals any line or block amount. Potential inclusion of OAS benefit amounts for &lt;Tax Year&gt; CRA – Income Validation(s) Any calculated estimated block is not equal to the actual income block from the base calendar year income. Estimated Income for &lt;Year&gt; needs to be reconciled for &lt;Participant Name&gt; Estimated Income Reconciliation The client has one of the following overrides: GIS Entitlement Amount ALW Entitlement Amount ALWS Entitlement Amount Rate Table: GIS Single Rate Table: GIS Married/C-L to Pensioner Rate Table: GIS Married/C-L to non-Pensioner Rate Table: GIS Married/C-L to Allowance Recipient Marital Relationship and Partner Requirement Survivor Status Individual Payment Income Total Payment Income No end date on at least one of the overrides above or end date is on/after July 1st &lt;SIN or Curam Reference Number&gt; - &lt;First Name&gt; &lt; Last Name&gt; - Review overrides on &lt;Case Type&gt; &lt;Reference Number&gt; that extend past the current payment period. Override Determination Once a client meets all the necessary requirements (e.g. having pending tasks resolved or overrides cleared) Cúram will automatically proceed with renewing the benefits. The system continuously checks for these conditions and benefit renewal is triggered once the conditions are satisfied. If a client does not meet the eligibility requirements for renewal, Cúram will create a task for an agent to review and resolve. Once the task is completed and the eligibility requirements are met, Cúram will automatically renew the benefit. Tasks that are not part of the eligibility rules do not stop the renewal of income-tested benefits. The ITB For Life status is automatically updated to Yes as a result of the eligibility determination process. Correspondence plays an important role in the renewal process. Cúram automatically sends letters to clients to ensure they have the information they need and that renewals are completed on time. Below is a list of correspondence generated by Cúram in July regarding the result of the renewal process: Correspondence Description GIS/ ALW / ALWS Entitlement Letter (ISP-3057) Renewal award letter for all income-tested benefits informing the client of their new entitlement amount and the payment income used to calculate the entitlement. GIS Suspension Letter (ISP-3067) Letter to inform clients that their new payment income puts them above the income threshold for GIS, thus making them not entitled for the benefit. ALW / ALWS Suspension Letter (ISP-3068) Letter to inform clients that their new payment income puts them above the income threshold for ALW or ALWS , making them not entitled for the benefit. GIS/ ALW / ALWS Non-Entitlement Letter (ISP-3056) Letter to inform clients that they are still not entitled to the income-tested benefit. Top tab: Reference There is no reference material.

Since April 1996, clients may receive 1/10th of the full benefit for each full year of residence in Canada, up to a maximum of 10 years (i.e. the full benefit means an SQF of 1.0). How the SQF works Table 1. Client value and SQF value Client Type SQF Value OAS approved without an International Social Security Agreement (ISSA) with 10 years or more of Canadian residence 1.0 OAS approved with an ISSA with less than 10 years of Canadian residence 0.1 x each full year of residence (to a maximum of 1.0) The SQF increases by 0.1 each year as the client reaches their next anniversary date of residence. For example, a client that entered Canada on March 15 would reach a year of residence the next year on March 14. Therefore, March would be the anniversary month and the SQF would increase effective April. Cúram will consider Residence period evidence to calculate the SQF. In the absence of a Residence period evidence, an SQF override equal to the total Canadian residence to a maximum of 10 years can be entered. Cúram will then calculate the SQF correctly. Cúram considerations for migrated accounts Updated Updated The GIS New Business application asks for only 2 years of residence. If that is the only residence period evidence in Cúram, the system assumes that is the total residence for the SQF calculation. Table 2. Application, information entered and how the system assumes SQF Application Information Entered System Assumes SQF GIS New Business Last 2 years 0.2 This often underrepresents a client’s true residence history, leading to incorrect benefit entitlement. How to Fix the SQF (preferred order) Updated Update the residence period in Cúram. Refer to Residence Period—Add, View and Edit in Cúram (Action) . Note: This is the best option as it avoids future overrides and ensures accurate records. Verify internal notes (e.g. ITRDS , address history). Extend the residence history to start at or before the date required to meet the full SQF. Add the complete residence period history in Cúram. Refer to Residence Period—Add, View and Edit in Cúram (Action) . Note: This option will avoid future overrides and ensures accurate records, but can be time consuming and may result in processing delays. Verify internal notes (e.g. ITRDS , address history). Request the file for the full residence history. Add an entitlement override for the SQF. Refer to Eligibility and Entitlement Override Evidence—Add, Edit, View, and Delete in Cúram (Action) . Updated For OAS approved without an ISSA, enter an SQF of 10. Updated For OAS approved under an ISSA, enter an SQF of 1 to 10 based on the number of full years of Canadian residence at the start date of the override. Create an OAS - Maintenance/Override Determination task in Cúram and: Add "SQF review related" as a comment in the task. Bring forward for follow-up to review at the residence anniversary date.

What you need to know Consent and Declaration evidence captures the applicant’s signature information. An applicant is: the individual applying for or requesting the benefit; or their legal representative applying for the benefit on their behalf. An applicant or their spouse or common-law partner must sign the application. If the applicant or their spouse or common-law partner signs with an “X”, it must be done in the presence of a witness. The witness must provide their name, address, telephone number, their relationship to the applicant, and sign and date the application. If a third party submits an application on behalf of an individual, they must also submit documentation to support that they are authorized to act on the individual's behalf, if it has not already been provided. For more information, refer to Third Party Requests (Scenario) . The Consent and Declaration evidence exists in the Application Case. When additional information is required for this evidence, Cúram will raise an issue on the evidence and create a task to verify the authorized person to block the benefit authorization at the time the application is submitted.
