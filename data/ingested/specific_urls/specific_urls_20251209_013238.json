beneficial relationships between the Employer, the employees and the Institute, to set forth certain terms and conditions of employment relating to remuneration, hours of work, employee benefits and general working conditions affecting employees covered by this agreement.\n1.02The parties to this agreement share a desire to improve the quality of the public service of Canada, to maintain professional standards and to promote the well-being and increased efficiency of its employees to the end that the people of Canada will be well and effectively served. Accordingly, they are determined to establish within the framework provided by law, an effective working relationship at all levels of the public service in which members of the bargaining unit are employed.\n\n### **Article 2: interpretation and definitions\n2.01For the purpose of this agreement:\n**\n**\n**\n2.02Except as otherwise provided in this agreement, expressions used in this agreement:\n  1. if defined in theFederal Public Sector Labour Relations Act, have the same meaning as given to them in theFederal Public Sector Labour Relations Act;and\n  2. if defined in theInterpretation Act, but not defined in theFederal Public Sector Labour Relations Act, have the same meaning as given to them in theInterpretation Act.\n\n### Article 3: official texts\n3.01Both the English and French texts of this agreement shall be official.\n\n### **Article 4: application\n4.01The provisions of this agreement apply to the Institute, employees and the Employer.\n**\n4.02The provisions of this agreement are intended to be gender-neutral and inclusive wherever possible. The binary nature of the French language does not always allow the designation of a person or a group by a neutral pronoun. The use of gender-neutral and gender-inclusive language in this agreement is not intended to change under any circumstances, the application, scope or value of any provision of this agreement.\n\n### Article 5: management rights\n5.01All the functions, rights, powers and authority which the Employer has not specifically abridged, delegated or modified by this agreement are recognized by the Institute as being retained by the Employer.\n\n### Article 6: rights of employees\n6.01Nothing in this agreement shall be construed as an abridgement or restriction of any employee’s constitutional rights or of any right expressly conferred in an act of the Parliament of Canada.\n\n## Part 2: working conditions\n\n### Article 7: hours of work and shift work\n7.01 Day work\n  1. The normal workweek shall be thirty-seven decimal five (37.5) hours and the normal workday shall be seven decimal five (7.5) consecutive hours, exclusive of a lunch period, between the hours of 6 am and 6 pm. The normal workweek shall be Monday to Friday inclusive. The Employer will provide two (2) 15-minute health breaks in a full working day except on occasions where operational requirements do not permit.\n  2. Where normal hours are to be changed so that they are different from those specified in paragraph 7.01(a) the Employer, in advance, except in cases of emergency, will consult with the Institute on such hours of work, and in such consultation, will show that such hours are required to meet the needs of the public and/or the efficient operation of the Service.\n  3. Upon the request of the employee and the concurrence of the manager, the parties may establish a flexible work schedule that is consistent with operational requirements.\n  4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, the implementation of any variation in hours shall not result in any additional overtime work or additional payment by reason only of such variation, nor shall it be deemed to prohibit the right of the Employer to schedule any hours of work permitted by the terms of this agreement.\n7.02Notwithstanding clause 7.01, the Employer may vary the normal weekly and daily hours of work to allow for summer and winter hours, provided the annual total is not changed.\n7.03An employee shall be granted two (2) consecutive days of rest during each seven (7) day period unless operational requirements do not so permit.\n7.04 Compressed workweek\n  1. Notwithstanding the provisions of this article, upon request of an employee and the concurrence of the Employer, an employee may complete their weekly hours of employment in a period other than five (5) full days provided that over a period of twenty-eight (28) calendar days the employee works an average of thirty-seven decimal five (37.5) hours per week. In every twenty-eight (28) day period such an employee shall be granted days of rest on such days as are not scheduled as a normal workday for the employee. The parties shall make every reasonable effort to establish mutually acceptable work schedules that are consistent with operational requirements and shall particularly consider any specific proposals made by an employee or employees. If employees’ requests for a variation in hours of work are consistent with the needs of the operational requirements, then such requests shall be implemented.\n  2. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, the implementation of any variation in hours shall not result in any additional overtime work or additional payment by reason only of such variation nor shall it be deemed to prohibit the right of the Employer to schedule any hours of work permitted by the terms of this agreement.\n7.05For an employee who completes required hours of work pursuant to clause 7.04, the agreement shall be administered as follows:\n  1. Article 2: interpretation and definitionsParagraph 2.01(d), “daily rate of pay,” shall not apply.\n  2. Article 12: designated paid holidaysA designated paid holiday shall account for seven decimal five (7.5) hours.\n  3. Article 13: travelling timeOn a normal workday, overtime compensation referred to in paragraph 13.04(b) shall only be applicable for hours in excess of the employee’s scheduled daily hours of work.\nParagraph 2.01(d), “daily rate of pay,” shall not apply.\nA designated paid holiday shall account for seven decimal five (7.5) hours.\nOn a normal workday, overtime compensation referred to in paragraph 13.04(b) shall only be applicable for hours in excess of the employee’s scheduled daily hours of work.\n7.06 Shift work\nWhen, because of the operational requirements of the Service, hours of work are scheduled for employees on a rotating or irregular basis, they shall be scheduled so that employees:\n  1. work an average of thirty-seven decimal five (37.5) hours per week exclusive of meal breaks;\n  2. obtain at least two (2) consecutive days of rest at any one time, except when days of rest are separated by a designated paid holiday which is not worked; the consecutive days of rest may be in separate calendar weeks.\n7.07Every reasonable effort shall be made by the Employer to consider the wishes of the employees concerned in the arrangement of shifts within a shift schedule.\n7.08The Employer will make every reasonable effort:\n  1. not to schedule the commencement of a shift within sixteen (16) hours of the completion of the employee’s previous shift;\n  2. to avoid excessive fluctuation in hours of work;\n  3. to post shift schedules at least twenty-one (21) days in advance.\n7.09The staffing, preparation, posting and administration of shift schedules is the responsibility of the Employer.\n7.10The Employer shall set up a shift schedule, which shall cover a period not exceeding two (2) months and not less than twenty-eight (28) consecutive days.\n7.11Provided sufficient advance notice is given and with the approval of the Employer, employees may exchange shifts if there is no increase in cost to the Employer.\n7.12\n  1. If an employee is given less than seven (7) days’ advance notice of a change in the employee’s shift schedule, the employee will receive compensation at the rate of time and one half (1 1/2) for work performed on the first (1st) shift changed. Subsequent shifts worked on the changed schedule shall be paid for at straight time, and every effort shall be made by the Employer to ensure that scheduled days of rest on the changed schedule are maintained.\n  2. Notwithstanding paragraph 7.12(a),when a change in a shift schedule is required and the employee agrees it is to the employee’s benefit to change the shift schedule, the employee shall be compensated at the straight-time rate for work performed in the first (1st) shift changed;andwhen an employee requests and the Employer agrees to change the employee’s shift schedule, the employee shall be paid at the straight-time rate for work performed on the first (1st) shift of the revised shift schedule.\n  1. when a change in a shift schedule is required and the employee agrees it is to the employee’s benefit to change the shift schedule, the employee shall be compensated at the straight-time rate for work performed in the first (1st) shift changed;and\n  2. when an employee requests and the Employer agrees to change the employee’s shift schedule, the employee shall be paid at the straight-time rate for work performed on the first (1st) shift of the revised shift schedule.\n7.13Where a new shift schedule has to be introduced by the Employer or an existing shift schedule has to be modified, the Employer, in advance, except in cases of emergency, will consult with the Institute on the timing of such shifts.\n7.14For the purpose of this agreement, when an employee’s shift does not commence and end on the same day, such shift shall be deemed for all purposes to have been entirely worked:\n  1. on the day it commenced where half (1/2) or more of the hours worked fall on that day;or\n  2. on the day it terminates where more than half (1/2) of the hours worked fall on that day.\n7.15A meal period shall be scheduled as close to the mid-point of the shift as possible.

An employee who is paid at a holding rate on the effective date of an economic increase, but who is removed from that holding rate prior to the effective date of a further economic increase by an amount less than the employee would have received by the application of paragraph 1 of Part II, shall receive a lump-sum payment equal to the difference between the amount equal to the difference between the amount calculated by the application of paragraph 1 of Part II and any increase in pay resulting from the employee’s removal from the holding rate.\nSigned at Ottawa, this 21st day of the month of July, 1982.\n\n## **Appendix “E”\n\n### Workforce adjustment\n\n#### Table of contents\n  • General**ApplicationCollective agreementObjectives**DefinitionsAuthoritiesMonitoring**References**Enquiries\n  • Part I: roles and responsibilities**1.1 Departments1.2 The Treasury Board Secretariat1.3 The Public Service Commission1.4 Employees\n  • Part II: official notification**2.1 Department\n  • Part III: relocation of a work unit**3.1 General\n  • Part IV: retraining4.1 General**4.2 Surplus employees**4.3 Laid-off persons\n  • Part V: salary protection5.1 Lower-level position\n  • Part VI: options for employees**6.1 General6.2 Voluntary programs**6.3 Alternation**6.4 Options6.5 Retention payment\n  • Part VII: special provisions regarding alternative delivery initiativesPreamble7.1 Definitions**7.2 General7.3 Responsibilities7.4 Notice of alternative delivery initiatives7.5 Job offers from new employers**7.6 Application of other provisions of the appendix7.7 Lump-sum payments and salary top-up allowances7.8 Reimbursement7.9 Vacation leave credits and severance pay\n  • **Annex A: statement of pension principles\n  • Annex B: Transition Support Measure\n  • **Annex C: Role of PSC in administering surplus and layoff priority entitlements\n  • **Application\n  • Collective agreement\n  • Objectives\n  • **Definitions\n  • Authorities\n  • Monitoring\n  • **References\n  • **Enquiries\n  • **1.1 Departments\n  • 1.2 The Treasury Board Secretariat\n  • 1.3 The Public Service Commission\n  • 1.4 Employees\n  • **2.1 Department\n  • **3.1 General\n  • 4.1 General\n  • **4.2 Surplus employees\n  • **4.3 Laid-off persons\n  • 5.1 Lower-level position\n  • **6.1 General\n  • 6.2 Voluntary programs\n  • **6.3 Alternation\n  • **6.4 Options\n  • 6.5 Retention payment\n  • Preamble\n  • 7.1 Definitions\n  • **7.2 General\n  • 7.3 Responsibilities\n  • 7.4 Notice of alternative delivery initiatives\n  • 7.5 Job offers from new employers\n  • **7.6 Application of other provisions of the appendix\n  • 7.7 Lump-sum payments and salary top-up allowances\n  • 7.8 Reimbursement\n  • 7.9 Vacation leave credits and severance pay\n\n#### General\n\n##### Application\n**\nThis appendix applies to all indeterminate employees.\nUnless explicitly specified, the provisions contained in Parts I to VI do not apply to alternative delivery initiatives.\n\n##### Collective agreement\nWith the exception of those provisions for which the Public Service Commission (PSC) is responsible, this appendix is part of this collective agreement.\n\n##### Objectives\nIt is the policy of the Treasury Board to maximize employment opportunities for indeterminate employees affected by workforce adjustment situations, primarily through ensuring that, wherever possible, alternative employment opportunities are provided to them. This should not be construed as the continuation of a specific position or job but rather as continued employment.\nTo this end, every indeterminate employee whose services will no longer be required because of a workforce adjustment situation and for whom the deputy head knows or can predict employment availability will receive a guarantee of a reasonable job offer within the core public administration. Those employees for whom the deputy head cannot provide the guarantee will have access to transitional employment arrangements (as per Part VI and VII).\n\n##### Definitions\n**\nOccurs when an opting employee (not a surplus employee) or a surplus employee having chosen option 6.4.1(a) who wishes to remain in the core public administration exchanges positions with a non-affected employee (the alternate) willing to leave the core public administration with a Transition Support Measure (TSM) or with an education allowance.\n**\nIs one of the options provided to an indeterminate employee affected by workforce adjustment for whom the deputy head cannot guarantee a reasonable job offer. The Education Allowance is a lump-sum payment, equal to the TSM (see Annex B), plus a reimbursement of tuition from a recognized learning institution, and of book and relevant equipment costs, up to a maximum of seventeen thousand dollars ($17,000).\n**\nA person who has been laid off is entitled to a priority, in accordance with subsection 41(4) of the PSEA with respect to any position to which the PSC is satisfied that the person meets the essential qualifications; the period of entitlement to this priority is as set out in thePublic Service Employment Regulations(PSER).\n**\nIs an offer of indeterminate employment within the core public administration, normally at an equivalent level but could include lower levels. Surplus employees must be both trainable and mobile. Where practicable, the search for a reasonable job offer will be conducted as follows: 1) within the employee’s headquarters as defined in theTravel Directive; 2) within forty kilometres (40 km) of the employee’s place of work or of the employee’s residence whichever will ensure continued employment; and 3) beyond forty kilometres (40 km). In Alternative Delivery situations, a reasonable offer is one that meets the criteria set out in type 1 and 2 of Part VII of this appendix. A reasonable job offer is also an offer from a FAA Schedule V Employer, providing that:\n  1. The appointment is at a rate of pay and an attainable salary maximum not less than the employee’s current salary and attainable maximum that would be in effect on the date of offer.\n  2. It is a seamless transfer of all employee benefits including a recognition of years of service for the definition of continuous employment and accrual of benefits, including the transfer of sick leave credits, severance pay and accumulated vacation leave credits.\n**\nIs an appointment priority accorded pursuant to paragraph 10(1) of thePublic Service Employment Regulations, to certain individuals salary-protected under this appendix for the purpose of assisting such persons to re-attain an appointment level equivalent to that from which they were declared surplus.\n**\n\n##### Authorities\nThe PSC has endorsed those portions of this appendix for which it has responsibility.\n\n##### Monitoring\nDepartments or organizations shall retain central information on all cases occurring under this appendix, including the reasons for the action; the number, occupational groups and levels of employees concerned; the dates of notice given; the number of employees placed without retraining; the number of employees retrained (including number of salary months used in such training); the levels of positions to which employees are appointed and the cost of any salary protection; and the number, types, and amounts of lump sums paid to employees.\nThis information will be used by the Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) to carry out its periodic audits.\n\n##### References\nThe primary references for the subject of workforce adjustment are as follows:\n**\n  • Financial Administration Act\n  • Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector\n  • Public Service Employment Act\n  • Public Service Employment Regulations\n  • Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act\n  • Public Service Superannuation Act\n  • Directive on Terms and Conditions of Employment\n  • NJC Relocation Directive\n  • Travel Directive\n\n##### Enquiries\nEnquiries about this appendix should be referred to PIPSC, or the responsible officers in departmental or organizational headquarters.\n**\nResponsible officers in departmental or organizational headquarters may, in turn, direct questions on the application of this appendix to the Senior Director, Union Engagement and National Joint Council Support, Employee Relations and Total Compensation Sector, TBS.\nEnquiries by employees pertaining to entitlements to a priority in appointment or to their status in relation to the priority appointment process should be directed to their departmental or organizational human resource advisors or to the priority advisor of the PSC responsible for their case.\n\n#### Part I: roles and responsibilities\n\n##### 1.1 Departments or organizations\n1.1.1Since indeterminate employees who are affected by workforce adjustment situations are not themselves responsible for such situations, it is the responsibility of departments or organizations to ensure that they are treated equitably and, given every reasonable opportunity to continue their careers as public service employees.\n1.1.2Departments or organizations shall carry out effective human resource planning to minimize the impact of workforce adjustment situations on indeterminate employees, on the department or organization, and on the public service.\n1.1.3Departments and organizations shall:\n  1. establish joint workforce adjustment committees, where appropriate, to advise and consult on the workforce adjustment situations within the department or organization,and\n  2. notify PIPSC of the responsible officers who will administer this appendix.\nTerms of reference of such committee shall include a process for addressing alternation requests from other departments and/or organizations.\n1.1.4Departments or organizations shall, as the home department or organization, cooperate with the PSC and appointing departments or organizations in joint efforts to redeploy departmental or organizational surplus employees and laid-off persons.\n1.1.5Departments or organizations shall establish systems to facilitate redeployment or retraining of the department’s or organization’s affected employees, surplus employees, and laid-off persons.\n1.1.6When a deputy head determines that the services of an employee are no longer required beyond a specified date due to lack of work or discontinuance of a function, the deputy head shall advise the employee, in writing, that their services will no longer be required. A copy of this letter shall be sent forthwith to the President of PIPSC.\nSuch a communication shall also indicate if the employee:\n  1. is being provided a guarantee of a reasonable job offer from the deputy head and that the employee will be in surplus status from that date on,or\n  2. is an opting employee and has access to the options of section 6.4 of this appendix because the employee is not in receipt of a guarantee of a reasonable job offer from the deputy head.\nWhere applicable, the communication should also provide the information relative to the employee’s possible layoff date.\n1.1.7Deputy heads will be expected to provide a guarantee of a reasonable job offer for those employees subject to workforce adjustment for whom they know or can predict employment availability in the core public administration.\n1.1.8Where a deputy head cannot provide a guarantee of a reasonable job offer, the deputy head will provide one hundred and twenty (120) days to consider the three (3) options outlined in Part VI of this appendix to all opting employees before a decision is required of them. If the employee fails to select an option, the employee will be deemed to have selected option 6.4.1(a), twelve (12) month surplus priority period in which to secure a reasonable job offer.\n1.1.9The deputy head shall make a determination to either provide a guarantee of a reasonable job offer or access to the options set out in 6.4 of this appendix, upon request of any indeterminate affected employee who can demonstrate that their duties have already ceased to exist.\n1.1.10Departments or organizations shall send written notice to the PSC of the employee’s surplus status, and shall send to the PSC such details, forms, resumés, and other material as the PSC may from time to time prescribe as necessary for it to discharge its function.\n1.1.11The home department or organization shall provide the PSC with a written statement that it would be prepared to appoint the surplus employee to a suitable position in the department or organization commensurate with the employee’s qualifications, if such a position were available.\n1.1.12Departments or organizations shall advise the President of PIPSC and consult with PIPSC representatives as completely as possible regarding any workforce adjustment situation as soon as possible after the decision has been made and throughout the process. When the affected employees are identified, the departments or organizations will forward the name, work location, phone number, email address and mailing address of affected employees as per the departmental or organizational employee database of those employees to the President of PIPSC.\n1.1.13Departments or organizations shall provide that employee with the official notification that the employee has become subject to a workforce adjustment and shall remind the employee that the Appendix on Workforce Adjustment of this collective agreement applies.\n1.1.14Deputy heads shall apply this appendix so as to keep actual involuntary layoffs to a minimum, and layoffs shall normally only occur where an individual has refused a reasonable job offer, or is not mobile, or cannot be retrained within two (2) years, or is laid off at the employee’s own request.\n1.1.15Departments or organizations are responsible to counsel and advise their affected employees on their opportunities of finding continuing employment in the public service and shall, to the extent possible, help market surplus employees and laid-off persons to other departments or organizations unless the individuals have advised the department or organization in writing that they are not available for appointment.\n1.1.16Appointment of surplus employees to alternative positions, whether with or without retraining, shall normally be at a level equivalent to that previously held by the employee, but this does not preclude appointment to a lower level. Departments or organizations shall avoid appointment to a lower level except where all other avenues have been exhausted.\n1.1.17Home departments or organizations shall appoint as many of their own surplus employees or laid-off persons as possible, or identify alternative positions (both actual and anticipated) for which individuals can be retrained.\n**\n1.1.18Home departments or organizations shall relocate surplus employees and laid-off persons, if necessary.\n1.1.19Relocation of surplus employees or laid-off persons shall be undertaken when the individuals indicate that they are willing to relocate and relocation will enable their redeployment or reappointment, providing that\n  1. there are no available priority persons, or priority persons with a higher priority, qualified and interested in the position being filled;or\n  2. no available local surplus employees or laid-off persons who are interested and who could qualify with retraining.\n1.1.20The cost of travelling to interviews for possible appointments and of relocation to the new location shall be borne by the employee’s home department or organization. Such cost shall be consistent with theTravel DirectiveandNJC Relocation Directive.\n1.1.21For the purposes of theNJC Relocation Directive, surplus employees and laid-off persons who relocate under this appendix shall be deemed to be employees on employer-requested relocations. The general rule on minimum distances for relocation applies.\n1.1.22For the purposes of theTravel Directive, laid-off persons travelling to interviews for possible reappointment to core public administration are deemed to be a “traveller” as defined in theTravel Directive.\n1.1.23For the surplus and/or layoff priority periods, home departments or organizations shall pay the salary, salary protection and/or termination costs as well as other authorized costs such as tuition, travel, relocation, and retraining as provided for in the various collective agreements and directives. The appointing department or organization may agree to absorb all or part of these costs.\n1.1.24Where a surplus employee is appointed by another department or organization to a term position, the home department or organization is responsible for the costs above for one (1) year from the date of such appointment, unless the home and appointing departments or organizations agree to a longer period, after which the appointing department or organization becomes the new home department or organization consistent with PSC authorities.\n1.1.25Departments or organizations shall protect the indeterminate status and surplus priority of a surplus indeterminate employee appointed to a term position under this appendix.\n**\n1.1.26Departments or organizations shall inform the PSC in a timely fashion, and in a method directed by the PSC, of the results of all referrals made to them under this appendix. In addition, departments or organizations shall provide feedback to surplus employees and laid-off persons when they are not offered a position for which they were referred.\n1.1.27Departments or organizations shall review the use of private temporary agency personnel, contractors, consultants, and their use of contracted out services, employees appointed for a specified period (terms) and all other non-indeterminate employees. Where practicable, departments or organizations shall not engage or re-engage such temporary agency personnel, contractors, consultants, contracted out services, nor renew the employment of such employees referred to above where such action would facilitate the appointment of surplus employees or laid-off persons.\n**\n1.1.28Nothing in the foregoing shall restrict the Employer’s right to engage or appoint persons to meet short-term, non-recurring requirements. Surplus employees and laid-off persons shall be given priority even for these short-term work opportunities.\n1.1.29Departments or organizations may lay off an employee at a date earlier than originally scheduled when the surplus employee requests them to do so in writing.\n**\n1.1.30Departments or organizations, acting as appointing departments or organizations, shall cooperate with the PSC and other departments or organizations in accepting, to the extent possible, affected employees, surplus employees and laid-off persons, from other departments or organizations for appointment or retraining.\n1.1.31Departments or organizations shall provide surplus employees with a layoff notice at least one (1) month before the proposed layoff date, if appointment efforts have been unsuccessful. Such notice shall be sent to the President of PIPSC.\n1.1.32When a surplus employee refuses a reasonable job offer, they shall be subject to layoff one (1) month after the refusal, however, not before six (6) months after the surplus declaration date. The provisions of 1.3.3 shall continue to apply.\n1.1.33Departments or organizations are to presume that each employee wishes to be redeployed unless the employee indicates the contrary in writing.\n1.1.34Departments or organizations shall inform and counsel affected and surplus employees as early and as completely as possible and shall, in addition, assign a counsellor to each opting and surplus employee and laid-off person to work with them throughout the process. Such counselling is to include explanations and assistance concerning:\n**\n  1. the workforce adjustment situation and its effect on that individual;\n  2. the Workforce Adjustment Appendix;\n  3. the PSC’s Priority Information Management System and how it works from the individual’s perspective;\n  4. preparation of a curriculum vitae or resumé;\n  5. the individual’s rights and obligations;\n  6. the individual’s current situation (for example, pay, benefits such as severance pay and superannuation, classification, language rights, years of service);\n  7. alternatives that might be available to the individual (the alternation process, appointment, relocation, retraining, lower-level employment, term employment, retirement including possibility of waiver of penalty if entitled to an annual allowance, Transition Support Measure, education allowance, payment in lieu of unfulfilled surplus period, resignation, accelerated layoff);\n  8. the likelihood that the individual will be successfully appointed;\n  9. the meaning of a “guarantee of reasonable job offer”, a “twelve (12) month surplus priority period in which to secure a reasonable job offer”, a “TSM”, an “education allowance”;\n  10. the options for individuals not in receipt of a guarantee of a reasonable job offer, the one hundred and twenty (120) day consideration period that includes access to the alternation process;\n  11. advise individuals to seek out proposed alternations and submit requests for approval as soon as possible after being informed they will not be receiving a guarantee of a reasonable job offer;\n  12. the Human Resources Centres and their services (including a recommendation that the employee register with the nearest office as soon as possible);\n  13. preparation for interviews with prospective employers;\n  14. repeat counselling as long as the individual is entitled to a staffing priority and has not been appointed;\n  15. advising the individual that refusal of a reasonable job offer will jeopardize both chances for retraining and overall employment continuity;\n  16. advising individuals of the right to be represented by the Institute in the application of this appendix;and\n**\n  1. the Employee Assistance Program.\n1.1.35Home departments or organizations shall ensure that, when it is required to facilitate appointment, a retraining plan is prepared and agreed to in writing by themselves, the employee and the appointing department or organization.\n1.1.36Severance pay and other benefits flowing from other clauses in this collective agreement are separate from, and in addition to, those in this appendix.\n1.1.37Any surplus employee who resigns under this appendix shall be deemed, for the purposes of severance pay and retroactive remuneration, to be involuntarily laid off on the day as of which the deputy head accepts in writing the employee’s resignation.\n1.1.38The department or organization will review the status of each affected employee annually, or earlier, from the date of initial notification of affected status and determine whether the employee will remain on affected status or not.\n1.1.39The department or organization will notify the affected employee, in writing, within five (5) working days of the decision pursuant to subsection 1.1.38.\n\n##### 1.2 The Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS)\n1.2.1It is the responsibility of the TBS to:\n  1. investigate and seek to resolve situations referred by the PSC or other parties,and\n  2. consider departmental or organizational requests for retraining resources,and\n  3. ensure that departments or organizations are provided to the extent possible with information on occupations for which there are skill shortages.\n\n##### 1.3 The Public Service Commission (PSC)\n1.3.1Within the context of workforce adjustment, and the PSC governing legislation, it is the responsibility of the PSC to:\n  1. ensure that priority entitlements are respected;\n  2. ensure that a means exists for priority persons to be assessed against vacant positions and appointed if found qualified against the essential qualifications of the position;and\n  3. ensure that priority persons are provided with information on their priority entitlements.\n1.3.2The PSC is further willing, in accordance with thePrivacy Act, to:\n  1. provide the TBS with information related to the administration of priority entitlements which may reflect on departments’ or organizations’ level of compliance with this appendix;and\n  2. provide information to the Institute on the numbers and status of their members in the Priority Information Management System, as well as information on the overall system.\n1.3.3The PSC’s roles and responsibilities flow from its governing legislation, not the collective agreement. As such, any changes made to these roles/responsibilities must be agreed upon by the PSC. For greater detail on the PSC’s role in administering surplus and layoff priority entitlements, refer to Annex C of this appendix.\n\n##### 1.4 Employees\n1.4.1Employees have the right to be represented by PIPSC in the application of this appendix.\n1.4.2Employees who are directly affected by workforce adjustment situations and who receive a guarantee of a reasonable job offer, or who opt, or are deemed to have opted, for option 6.4.1(a) of Part VI of this appendix are responsible for:\n  1. actively seeking alternative employment in cooperation with their departments or organizations and the PSC, unless they have advised the department or organization and the PSC, in writing, that they are not available for appointment;\n  2. seeking information about their entitlements and obligations;\n  3. providing timely information to the home department or organization and to the PSC to assist them in their appointment activities (including curriculum vitae or resumés);\n  4. ensuring that they can be easily contacted by the PSC and appointing departments or organizations, and attending appointments related to referrals;\n  5. seriously considering job opportunities presented to them (referrals within the home department or organization, referrals from the PSC, and job offers made by departments or organizations), including retraining and relocation possibilities, specified period appointments and lower-level appointments.\n1.4.3Opting employees are responsible for:\n  1. considering the options of Part VI of this appendix;\n  2. communicating their choice of options, in writing, to their manager no later than one hundred and twenty (120) days after being declared opting;and\n  3. submitting an alternation request to management before the close of the one hundred and twenty (120) day period, if arranging an alternation with an unaffected employee.\n\n#### Part II: official notification\n\n##### 2.1 Department or organization\n2.1.1As already mentioned in section 1.1.12, departments or organizations shall advise and consult with the Institute representatives as completely as possible regarding any workforce adjustment situation as soon as possible after the decision has been made and throughout the process and will make available to the Institute and to the President of PIPSC the name, work location, phone number, email address and mailing address of affected employees as per the departmental or organizational employee database of those employees.\n**\n2.1.2In any workforce adjustment situation which is likely to involve six (6) or more indeterminate employees covered by this appendix, the department or organization concerned shall notify the Treasury Board Secretariat, in writing and in confidence, at the earliest possible date and under no circumstances less than four (4) working days before the situation is announced.\n2.1.3Prior to notifying any potentially affected employee, departments or organizations shall also notify the President of the Institute that has members involved. Such notification is to be in writing, in confidence and at the earliest possible date and under no circumstances less than two (2) working days before any employee is notified of the workforce adjustment situation.

When an individual accepts an appointment to a position with a lower maximum rate of pay than the position from which they were laid off, the employee will be salary protected in accordance with Part V.\n\n#### Part V: salary protection\n\n##### 5.1 Lower-level position\n5.1.1Surplus employees and laid-off persons appointed to a lower-level position under this appendix shall have their salary and pay equity equalization payments, if any, protected in accordance with the salary protection provisions of this collective agreement, or, in the absence of such provisions, the appropriate provisions of theDirective on Terms and Conditions of Employment.\n5.1.2Employees whose salary is protected pursuant to section 5.1.1 will continue to benefit from salary protection until such time as they are appointed or deployed into a position with a maximum rate of pay that is equal to or higher than the maximum rate of pay of the position from which they were declared surplus or laid off.\n\n#### Part VI: options for employees\n\n##### 6.1 General\n6.1.1Deputy heads will be expected to provide a guarantee of a reasonable job offer for those affected employees for whom they know or can predict employment availability. A deputy head who cannot provide such a guarantee shall provide reasons in writing, if requested by the employee. Affected employees in receipt of this guarantee would not have access to the choice of options below.\n6.1.2Employees who are not in receipt of a guarantee of a reasonable job offer from their deputy head have one hundred and twenty (120) days to consider the three (3) options below before a decision is required of them, and\nThe employee may also participate in the alternation process in accordance with section 6.3 of this appendix within the one hundred and twenty (120) day window before a decision is required of them in 6.1.3.\n6.1.3The opting employee must choose, in writing, one of the three options of section 6.4 of this appendix within the one hundred and twenty (120) day window. The employee cannot change options once having made a written choice. The department shall send a copy of the employee’s choice to the President of PIPSC.\n6.1.4If the employee fails to select an option, the employee will be deemed to have selected option (a), twelve (12) month surplus priority period in which to secure a reasonable job offer at the end of the one hundred and twenty (120) day window.\n6.1.5If a reasonable job offer which does not require a relocation is made at any time during the one hundred and twenty (120) day opting period and prior to the written acceptance of the TSM or the education allowance option, the employee is ineligible for the TSM or the education allowance.\n**\n6.1.6A copy of any letter issued by the departments or organizations under this part or notice of layoff pursuant to the PSEA shall be sent forthwith to the President of PIPSC.\n\n##### 6.2 Voluntary departure program\nThe Voluntary Departure Program supports employees in leaving the public service when placed in affected status prior to entering a Selection of Employees for Retention or Layoff (SERLO) process, and does not apply if the deputy head can provide a guarantee of a reasonable job offer (GRJO) to affected employees in the work unit.\n6.2.1Departments and organizations shall establish internal voluntary departure programs for all workforce adjustment situations in which the workforce will be reduced and that involves five (5) or more affected employees working at the same group and level within the same work unit and where the deputy head cannot provide a guarantee of a reasonable job offer.\n6.2.2When such voluntary programs are established, employees who volunteer and who are selected for workforce adjustment will be made opting employees.\n6.2.3When the number of volunteers is larger than the required number of positions to be eliminated, volunteers will be selected based on seniority (total years of service in the public service, whether continuous or discontinuous).\n\n##### 6.3 Alternation\n6.3.1All departments or organizations must participate in the alternation process.\n**\n6.3.2An alternation occurs when an opting employee or a surplus employee having chosen option 6.4.1(a) who wishes to remain in the core public administration exchanges positions with a non-affected employee (the alternate) willing to leave the core public administration under the terms of Part VI of this appendix.\n6.3.3\n  1. Only opting and surplus employees who are surplus as a result of having chosen option 6.4.1(a) may alternate into an indeterminate position that remains in the core public administration.\n  2. If an alternation is proposed for a surplus employee, as opposed to an opting employee, the TSM that is available to the alternate under 6.4.1(b) or 6.4.1(c)(i) shall be reduced by one week for each completed week between the beginning of the employee’s surplus priority period and the date the alternation is proposed.\n**\n6.3.4An indeterminate employee wishing to leave the core public administration may express an interest in alternating with an opting employee or a surplus employee who is surplus as a result of having chosen option 6.4.1(a). Management will decide, however, whether a proposed alternation will result in retaining the skills required to meet the ongoing needs of the position and the core public administration.\n6.3.5An alternation must permanently eliminate a function or a position.\n**\n6.3.6The opting employee or surplus employee having chosen option 6.4.1(a) moving into the unaffected position must be, to the degree determined by the Employer, able to meet the requirements of the position, including language requirements. The alternate moving into the opting position must meet the requirements of the position, except if the alternate will not be performing the duties of the position and the alternate will be struck off strength within five (5) days of the alternation.\n6.3.7An alternation should normally occur between employees at the same group and level. When the two (2) positions are not the same group and level, alternation can still occur when the positions can be considered equivalent. They are considered equivalent when the maximum rate of pay for the higher-paid position is no more than six per cent (6%) higher than the maximum rate of pay for the lower paid position.\n6.3.8An alternation must occur on a given date, that is, two (2) employees directly exchange positions on the same day. There is no provision in alternation for a “domino” effect or for “future considerations.”\nFor clarity, the alternation of positions shall take place on a given date after approval but may take place after the opting one hundred and twenty (120) day period, such as when the processing of the approved alternation is delayed due to the administrative requirements.\n**\n6.3.9If an alternation is denied, a meeting to discuss the rationale for the decision will be held at the employee’s request. The Institute representative may attend the meeting.\n\n##### 6.4 Options\n6.4.1Only opting employees who are not in receipt of the guarantee of a reasonable job offer from the deputy head will have access to the choice of options below:\n  1.

The amount of the lump-sum payment for the pay in lieu cannot exceed the maximum of that which the employee would have received had they chosen option 6.4.1(b), the TSM.Departments or organizations will make every reasonable effort to market a surplus employee during the employee’s surplus period within the employee’s preferred area of mobility.or\n  2. TSM is a lump-sum payment, based on the employee’s years of service in the public service (see Annex B) made to an opting employee.

At the end of the two (2) year leave without pay period, unless the employee has found alternate employment in the core public administration, the employee will be laid off in accordance with the PSEA.\n6.4.2Management will establish the departure date of opting employees who choose option 6.4.1(b) or option 6.4.1(c) above.\n6.4.3The TSM, pay in lieu of unfulfilled surplus period and the education allowance cannot be combined with any other payment under the Workforce Adjustment Appendix.\n6.4.4In the cases of: pay in lieu of unfulfilled surplus period, option 6.4.1(b) and 6.4.1(c)(i), the employee relinquishes any priority rights for reappointment upon acceptance of their resignation.\n6.4.5Employees choosing option 6.4.1(c)(ii) who have not provided their department or organization with a proof of registration from a learning institution twelve (12) months after starting their leave without pay period will be deemed to have resigned from the core public administration, and be considered to be laid off for purposes of severance pay.\n**\n6.4.6All opting employees will be entitled to up to one thousand two hundred dollars ($1,200) towards counselling services in respect of their potential re-employment or retirement. Such counselling services may include financial, and job placement counselling services.\n**\n6.4.7A person who has received pay in lieu of unfulfilled surplus period, a TSM or an education allowance and is reappointed to the public service shall reimburse the Receiver General for Canada by an amount corresponding to the period from the effective date of such reappointment or hiring, to the end of the original period for which the TSM or education allowance was paid.\n**\n6.4.8Notwithstanding section 6.4.7, an opting employee who has received an education allowance will not be required to reimburse tuition expenses, costs of books and relevant equipment, for which the employee cannot get a refund.\n6.4.9The deputy head shall ensure that pay in lieu of unfulfilled surplus period is only authorized where the employee’s work can be discontinued on the resignation date and no additional costs will be incurred in having the work done in any other way during that period.\n6.4.10If a surplus employee who has chosen, or is deemed to have chosen, option 6.4.1(a) refuses a reasonable job offer at any time during the twelve (12) month surplus priority period, the employee is ineligible for pay in lieu of unfulfilled surplus period.\n6.4.11Approval of pay in lieu of unfulfilled surplus period is at the discretion of management, but shall not be unreasonably denied.\n\n##### 6.5 Retention payment\n6.5.1There are three (3) situations in which an employee may be eligible to receive a retention payment. These are total facility closures, relocation of work units and alternative delivery initiatives.\n6.5.2All employees accepting retention payments must agree to leave the core public administration without priority rights.\n6.5.3An individual who has received a retention payment and, as applicable, is either reappointed, or hired to that portion of the core public administration specified from

the provisions of this part will be guided by the following principles:\n  1. fair and reasonable treatment of employees;\n  2. value for money and affordability;and\n  3. maximization of employment opportunities for employees.\nThe parties recognize:\n  • the Union’s need to represent employees during the transition process;\n  • the Employer’s need for greater flexibility in organizing the core public administration.\n\n##### 7.1 Definitions\nFor the purposes of this part,an alternative delivery initiative(diversification des modes d’exécution) is the transfer of any work, undertaking or business of the core public administration to any body or corporation that is a separate agency or that is outside the core public administration.\nFor the purposes of this part, areasonable job offer(offre d’emploi raisonnable) is an offer of employment received from a new employer in the case of a type 1 or 2 transitional employment arrangement, as determined in accordance with section 7.2.2.\nFor the purposes of this part, atermination of employment(licenciement d’une personne) is the termination of employment referred to in paragraph 12(1)(f) of the FAA.\n\n##### 7.2 General\nDepartments or organizations will, as soon as possible after the decision is made to proceed with an alternative delivery initiative (ADI), and if possible, not less than one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the date of transfer, provide notice to the President of PIPSC.\nThe notice to PIPSC will include: 1) the program being considered for ADI, 2) the reason for the ADI, and 3) the type of approach anticipated for the initiative.\n**\nA joint Workforce Adjustment-Alternative Delivery Initiative (WFA-ADI) committee will be created for ADI and will have equal representation from the department or organization and PIPSC. By mutual agreement, the committee may include other participants. The joint WFA-ADI committee will define the rules of conduct of the committee.\n**\nIn cases of ADI, the parties will establish a joint WFA-ADI committee to conduct meaningful consultation on the human resources issues related to the ADI in order to provide information to the employee which will assist them in deciding on whether or not to accept the job offer.\n  1. CommercializationIn cases of commercialization where tendering will be part of the process, the parties shall make every reasonable effort to come to an agreement on the criteria related to human resources issues (for example, terms and conditions of employment, pension and health care benefits, the take-up number of employees) to be used in the request for proposal (RFP) process. The parties will respect the contracting rules of the federal government.\n  2. Creation of a new agencyIn cases of the creation of new agencies, the parties shall make every reasonable effort to agree on common recommendations related to human resources issues (for example, terms and conditions of employment, pension, and health care benefits) that should be available at the date of transfer.\n  3. Transfer to existing employersIn all other ADI initiatives where an employer-employee relationship already exists the parties will hold meaningful consultations to clarify the terms and conditions that will apply upon transfer.In the cases of commercialization and creation of new agencies, consultation opportunities will be given to PIPSC; however, if after meaningful consultation agreements are not possible, the department may still proceed with the transfer.\nIn cases of commercialization where tendering will be part of the process, the parties shall make every reasonable effort to come to an agreement on the criteria related to human resources issues (for example, terms and conditions of employment, pension and health care benefits, the take-up number of employees) to be used in the request for proposal (RFP) process.

The new employer will have in place, or His Majesty in right of Canada will require the new employer to put in place, reasonable pension arrangements for transferring employees. The test of reasonableness will be that the actuarial value (cost) of the new employer pension arrangements will be at least six decimal five per cent (6.5%) of pensionable payroll, which in the case of defined-benefit pension plans will be as determined by the Assessment Methodology developed by Towers Perrin for the Treasury Board, dated October 7, 1997. This Assessment Methodology will apply for the duration of this collective agreement. Where there is no reasonable pension arrangement in place on the transfer date or no written undertaking by the new employer to put such reasonable pension arrangement in place effective on the transfer date, subject to the approval of Parliament and a written undertaking by the new employer to pay the employer costs,Public Service Superannuation Act(PSSA) coverage could be provided during a transitional period of up to a year.\n  2. Benefits in respect of service accrued to the point of transfer are to be fully protected.\n  3. His Majesty in right of Canada will seek portability arrangements between the Public Service Superannuation Plan and the pension plan of the new employer where a portability arrangement does not yet exist. Furthermore, His Majesty in right of Canada will seek authority to permit employees the option of counting their service with the new employer for vesting and benefit thresholds under the PSSA.\n\n#### Annex B: Transition Support Measure\n\n| Years of service in the public service | Transition Support Measure (TSM) (payment in weeks’ pay) |\n| --- | --- |\n| 0 | 10 |\n| 1 | 22 |\n| 2 | 24 |\n| 3 | 26 |\n| 4 | 28 |\n| 5 | 30 |\n| 6 | 32 |\n| 7 | 34 |\n| 8 | 36 |\n| 9 | 38 |\n| 10 | 40 |\n| 11 | 42 |\n| 12 | 44 |\n| 13 | 46 |\n| 14 | 48 |\n| 15 | 50 |\n| 16 | 52 |\n| 17 | 52 |\n| 18 | 52 |\n| 19 | 52 |\n| 20 | 52 |\n| 21 | 52 |\n| 22 | 52 |\n| 23 | 52 |\n| 24 | 52 |\n| 25 | 52 |\n| 26 | 52 |\n| 27 | 52 |\n| 28 | 52 |\n| 29 | 52 |\n| 30 | 49 |\n| 31 | 46 |\n| 32 | 43 |\n| 33 | 40 |\n| 34 | 37 |\n| 35 | 34 |\n| 36 | 31 |\n| 37 | 28 |\n| 38 | 25 |\n| 39 | 22 |\n| 40 | 19 |\n| 41 | 16 |\n| 42 | 13 |\n| 43 | 10 |\n| 44 | 07 |\n| 45 | 04 |\nFor indeterminate seasonal and part-time employees, the TSM will be pro-rated in the same manner as severance pay under the terms of this collective agreement.\nSeverance pay provisions of this collective agreement are in addition to the TSM.\n\n#### **Annex C: role of PSC in administering surplus and layoff priority entitlements\n  1.

The effective dates for economic increases will be specified in the collective agreement. Other provisions of the collective agreement will be effective as follows:All components of the agreement unrelated to pay administration will come into force on signature of this agreement unless otherwise expressly stipulated.Changes to existing and new compensation elements such as premiums, allowances, insurance premiums and coverage and changes to overtime rates will become effective within one hundred and eighty (180) days after signature of this agreement, on the date at which prospective elements of compensation increases will be implemented under 2.a).Payment of premiums, allowances, insurance premiums and coverage and overtime rates in the collective agreement will continue to be paid as per the previous provisions until changes come into force as stipulated in 1.b).\n  2. The collective agreement will be implemented over the following time frames:The prospective elements of compensation increases (such as prospective salary rate changes and other compensation elements such as premiums, allowances, changes to overtime rates) will be implemented within one hundred and eighty (180) days after signature of this agreement where there is no need for manual intervention.Retroactive amounts payable to employees will be implemented within one hundred and eighty (180) days after signature of this agreement where there is no need for manual intervention.Prospective compensation increases and retroactive amounts that require manual processing will be implemented within four hundred and sixty (460) days after signature of this agreement.\n  3.

This amount will be included in their final retroactive payment.Employees will be provided a detailed breakdown of the retroactive payments received and may request that the compensation services of their department or the Public Service Pay Centre verify the calculation of their retroactive payments, where they believe these amounts are incorrect. The Employer will consult with the Institute regarding the format of the detailed breakdown.In such a circumstance, for employees in organizations serviced by the Public Service Pay Centre, they must first complete a Phoenix feedback form indicating what period they believe is missing from their pay. For employees in organizations not serviced by the Public Service Pay Centre, employees shall contact the compensation services of their department.\n  1.

Par conséquent, elles sont décidées à établir, dans le cadre des lois existantes, des rapports efficaces à tous les niveaux de la fonction publique auxquels appartiennent les personnes salariées faisant partie de l’unité de négociation.\n\n### **Article 2 : interprétation et définitions\n2.01Aux fins de l’application de la présente convention, le terme :\n**\n**\n**\n2.02Sauf indication contraire dans la présente convention, les expressions qui y sont employées :\n  1. si elles sont définies dans laLoi sur les relations de travail le secteur public fédéral, ont le même sens qui leur est donné dans cette loi;et\n  2. si elles sont définies dans laLoi d’interprétationet non pas dans laLoi sur les relations de travail le secteur public fédéral, ont le même sens que celui qui leur est donné dans laLoi d’interprétation.\n\n### Article 3 : textes officiels\n3.01Les textes anglais et français de la présente convention sont des textes officiels.\n\n### **Article 4 : champ d’application\n4.01Les dispositions de la présente convention s’appliquent à l’Institut, aux personnes salariées et à l’employeur.\n**\n4.02Les dispositions de la présente convention visent la neutralité et l’inclusivité au niveau des genres dans la mesure du possible. La nature binaire de la langue française ne permet pas toujours la désignation d’une personne ou d’un groupe par un pronom neutre. Cependant, l’utilisation d’un langage neutre et inclusif au niveau des genres dans la présente convention n’a pas pour effet de modifier en toutes circonstances, l’application, la portée ou la valeur des dispositions de la présente convention.\n\n### Article 5 : droits de la direction\n5.01L’Institut reconnaît que l’employeur retient toutes les fonctions, les droits, les pouvoirs et l’autorité que ce dernier n’a pas, d’une façon précise, fait diminuer, déléguer ou modifier par la présente convention.\n\n### Article 6 : droits des personnes salariées\n6.01Rien dans la présente convention ne peut être interprété comme une diminution ou une restriction des droits constitutionnels ou de tout autre droit d’une personne salariée qui sont accordés explicitement par une loi du Parlement du Canada.\n\n## Partie 2 : conditions de travail\n\n### Article 7 : durée du travail et travail par postes\n7.01 Travail de jour\n  1. La semaine de travail normale est de trente-sept virgule cinq (37,5) heures et la journée de travail normale est de sept virgule cinq (7,5) heures consécutives, à l’exclusion d’une pause-repas, et se situe entre six (6) heures et dix-huit (18) heures. La semaine de travail normale est du lundi au vendredi inclusivement. L’employeur doit assurer deux (2) périodes de repos de quinze (15) minutes chacune par journée de travail complète, sauf dans les cas où les nécessités du service ne le permettent pas.\n  2. Lorsqu’il faut changer les heures normales de façon qu’elles diffèrent de celles qui sont indiquées à l’alinéa 7.01a), l’employeur, sauf dans les cas d’urgence, doit, au préalable, tenir des consultations avec l’Institut au sujet de ces heures de travail et, lors de ces consultations, doit établir que les heures en question sont nécessaires pour répondre aux besoins du public et/ou de l’exploitation efficiente du service.\n  3. À la demande de la personne salariée et si la ou le gestionnaire y consent les parties peuvent établir un horaire de travail flexible conforme aux exigences opérationnelles.\n  4. Nonobstant toute disposition contraire dans la présente convention, la mise en œuvre d’un horaire de travail différent ne doit pas entraîner des heures supplémentaires additionnelles ni une rémunération supplémentaire du seul fait du changement d’horaire, et ne doit pas non plus être réputée retirer à l’employeur le droit d’établir la durée du travail stipulée dans la présente convention.\n7.02Malgré le paragraphe 7.01, l’employeur peut modifier les durées hebdomadaires et journalières normales de travail pour permettre l’établissement d’horaires d’été et d’hiver à la condition que le total annuel des heures demeure inchangé.\n7.03Lorsque les nécessités du service le permettent, toute personne salariée bénéficie de deux (2) jours consécutifs de repos au cours de chaque période de sept (7) jours.\n7.04 Semaine de travail comprimée\n  1. Nonobstant les dispositions du présent article, sur demande de la personne salariée et avec l’approbation de l’employeur, la personne salariée peut répartir sa semaine de travail autrement que sur une période de cinq (5) jours, à condition que, au cours d’une période de vingt-huit (28) jours civils, elle travaille en moyenne trente-sept virgule cinq (37,5) heures par semaine. Au cours de chaque période de vingt-huit (28) jours, la personne salariée bénéficie de jours de repos les jours qui ne figurent pas à son horaire de travail normal. Les parties devront faire tout effort raisonnable pour établir des horaires de travail qui leur soient mutuellement acceptables et qui respectent les nécessités du service, et elles devront, en particulier, examiner toute proposition précise faite par une personne salariée ou un groupe de personnes salariées. Si les demandes de modification des horaires de travail présentées par les personnes salariées respectent les nécessités du service, elles devront être mises en œuvre.\n  2. Nonobstant toute disposition contraire dans la présente convention, la mise en œuvre de toute modification éventuelle des horaires ne devra pas se traduire, en elle-même, par de nouvelles heures de travail supplémentaires ou par des frais additionnels et ne devra pas annuler le droit de l’employeur de fixer les horaires de travail aux termes de la présente convention.\n7.05Pour une personne salariée qui complète les heures de travail requises conformément au paragraphe 7.04, la présente convention sera appliquée comme suit.\n  1. Article 2: interprétations et définitionsL’alinéa 2.01r), « taux de rémunération journalier », ne s’applique pas.\n  2. Article 12: jours fériés désignés payésUn jour férié désigné payé correspond à sept virgule cinq (7,5) heures.\n  3. Article 13: temps de déplacementPour un jour de travail normal, la rémunération des heures supplémentaires dont il est question à l’alinéa 13.04b) s’appliquera seulement aux heures effectuées par une personne salariée en sus de ses heures de travail quotidiennes prévues à l’horaire.\nL’alinéa 2.01r), « taux de rémunération journalier », ne s’applique pas.\nUn jour férié désigné payé correspond à sept virgule cinq (7,5) heures.\nPour un jour de travail normal, la rémunération des heures supplémentaires dont il est question à l’alinéa 13.04b) s’appliquera seulement aux heures effectuées par une personne salariée en sus de ses heures de travail quotidiennes prévues à l’horaire.\n7.06 Travail par postes\nLorsque, à cause des nécessités du service, la durée du travail des personnes salariées est répartie par roulement ou de façon irrégulière, elle doit être fixée de manière à ce que les personnes salariées :\n  1. travaillent en moyenne trente-sept virgule cinq (37,5) heures par semaine à l’exclusion des pauses-repas;\n  2. bénéficient d’au moins deux (2) jours de repos consécutifs en un moment donné, sauf quand un jour férié désigné payé qui est un jour chômé sépare les jours de repos; les jours de repos consécutifs peuvent faire partie de semaines civiles séparées.\n7.07L’employeur tâchera, dans la mesure du possible, de prendre en considération les désirs des personnes salariées quand il établit les postes à l’intérieur d’un horaire de travail par postes.\n7.08L’employeur fait tout effort raisonnable :\n  1. pour ne pas prévoir à l’horaire un commencement de poste dans les seize (16) heures qui suivent la fin du poste précédent de la personne salariée;\n  2. pour éviter les fluctuations excessives des heures de travail;\n  3. pour afficher les 0horaires de postes au moins vingt et un (21) jours à l’avance.\n7.09La dotation en personnel, l’établissement, l’affichage et l’exécution des horaires de postes sont la responsabilité de l’employeur.\n7.10L’employeur établit le calendrier des postes qui doit porter sur une période qui ne dépasse pas deux (2) mois et n’est pas inférieure à vingt-huit (28) jours consécutifs.\n7.11Pourvu qu’un préavis soit donné dans un délai suffisant, et avec l’autorisation de l’employeur, les personnes salariées peuvent s’échanger des postes si cela n’augmente pas les frais de l’employeur.\n7.12\n  1.

Les paragraphes suivants s’appliqueront dans tous les autres cas.\n23.02Dans le présent article, l’expression « changements technologiques » signifie la mise en place par l’employeur de ce qui suit :\n  1. équipement ou matériel d’une nature sensiblement différente de ceux utilisés précédemment,\n  2. changement important dans les activités de l’employeur directement reliées à la mise en place de cet équipement ou de ce matériel,\n  3. nouveau système, logiciel ou matériel technologiques de nature sensiblement différente de ce qui était utilisé précédemment,ou\n  4. changement technologique apporté à un système, logiciel ou matériel qui modifie sensiblement la nature de ceux-ci par rapport à ce qui était utilisé auparavant,\nqui entraînera des changements importants sur le plan de la situation d’emploi ou des conditions de travail des personnes salariées et qui nécessitera de la part des personnes salariées l’acquisition de connaissances et compétences nouvelles ou plus poussées afin de pouvoir atteindre les objectifs énoncés.\n23.03Les deux (2) parties reconnaissent les avantages potentiels des changements technologiques. En conséquence, elles encourageront et favoriseront les changements technologiques dans les activités de l’employeur. Lorsqu’il faut réaliser des changements technologiques, l’employeur cherchera des moyens pour réduire au minimum les effets négatifs qui pourraient en découler pour les personnes salariées.\n23.04Sauf en cas d’urgence, l’employeur convient de fournir à l’Institut un préavis écrit aussi long que possible, mais d’au moins cent vingt (120) jours, de la mise en place ou de la mise en œuvre de changements technologiques.\n23.05Le préavis écrit dont il est question au paragraphe 23.04 fournira les renseignements suivants :\n  1. la nature et l’ampleur des changements;\n  2. la ou les date(s) à laquelle/auxquelles l’employeur prévoit effectuer les changements;et\n  3. le ou les lieu(x) concerné(s).\n23.06Aussitôt que c’est raisonnablement possible après que le préavis a été donné conformément au paragraphe 23.04, l’employeur doit consulter l’Institut d’une manière significative au sujet des répercussions, sur chaque groupe de personnes salariées, des changements technologiques dont il est question audit paragraphe. Cette consultation portera sur les sujets suivants, sans y être limitée nécessairement :\n  1. le nombre approximatif, la catégorie et le lieu de travail des personnes salariées susceptibles d’être touchées par les changements;\n  2. les répercussions que les changements pourraient avoir sur les conditions de travail ou les conditions d’emploi des personnes salariées;et\n  3. l’avantage reconnu des conseils spécialisés des personnes salariées qui travaillent directement dans leurs domaines de compétence respectifs, et un effort raisonnable sera fait pour obtenir ces avis spécialisés ou d’autres conseils et recommandations en matière de technologie.\n23.07Lorsque, à la suite de changements technologiques, l’employeur décide qu’une personne salariée doit acquérir de nouvelles compétences ou connaissances pour exécuter les fonctions régulières ou révisées de son poste d’attache, l’employeur, suite à une consultation avec la personne salariée, et à moins de circonstances exceptionnelles, devra fournir sans frais, à la personne salariée, la formation et/ou le transfert de connaissances nécessaires pendant ses heures de travail.\n\n## Partie 3 : affaires concernant les relations de travail\n\n### **Article 24 : reconnaissance syndicale\n**\n24.01L’employeur reconnaît l’Institut comme agent de négociation unique de toutes les personnes salariées décrites comme fonctionnaires dans le certificat émis par la Commission des relations de travail et de l’emploi dans le secteur public fédéral le 1er avril 2019 qui vise les fonctionnaires de l’employeur compris dans le groupe Technologies de l’information, anciennement connu sous le nom de groupe Systèmes d’ordinateurs.\n24.02L’employeur reconnaît que les négociations collectives conduites en vue de conclure une convention collective constituent une fonction appropriée et un droit de l’Institut, et l’Institut et l’employeur conviennent de négocier de bonne foi conformément aux dispositions de laLoi sur les relations de travail dans le secteur public fédéral.\n\n### Article 25 : retenues syndicales\n25.01Sous réserve des dispositions du présent article et à titre de condition d’emploi, l’employeur retient sur la rémunération mensuelle de toutes les personnes salariées de l’unité de négociation un montant qui est égal aux cotisations syndicales.\nLorsqu’il n’est pas fait de retenue de cotisations à l’égard d’une personne salariée au sujet d’un mois donné parce que la personne salariée n’a pas touché de rémunération ou parce qu’elle était insuffisante pour permettre de les déduire, l’employeur n’est pas tenu de faire la retenue au titre du mois en question sur la rémunération de la personne salariée acquise par la suite.\n25.02L’Institut informe l’employeur par écrit du montant qu’il est autorisé à retenir chaque mois pour chaque personne salariée visée au paragraphe 25.01.\n25.03Aux fins de l’application du paragraphe 25.01, les retenues mensuelles sur la rémunération de chaque personne salariée se font à partir du premier (1er) mois complet d’emploi dans la mesure où il y a des gains.\n25.04N’est pas assujettie au présent article, la personne salariée qui convainc l’Institut, du bien-fondé de sa demande et affirme dans une déclaration faite sous serment, qu’elle est membre d’un organisme religieux dont la doctrine lui interdit, en conscience, de verser des contributions pécuniaires à une organisation syndicale et qu’elle versera à un organisme de charité enregistré en vertu de laLoi de l’impôt sur le revenudes contributions égales au montant des cotisations, à condition que la déclaration de la personne salariée soit contresignée par une représentante officielle ou un représentant officiel de l’organisme religieux en question.

Les parties reconnaissent l’utilité d’une explication officieuse entre les personnes salariées et leurs superviseures ou superviseurs et entre l’Institut et l’employeur de façon à résoudre les problèmes sans avoir recours à un grief officiel. Lorsqu’une personne salariée ou l’Institut annonce, dans les délais prescrits au paragraphe 33.12, qu’elle désire se prévaloir du paragraphe présent, il est entendu que la période couvrant l’explication initiale jusqu’à la réponse finale ne doit pas être comptée comme comprise dans les délais prescrits lors d’un grief.\n33.06L’auteure ou l’auteur du grief qui désire présenter son grief, à l’un des paliers prescrits par la procédure de règlement des griefs, le remet à sa superviseure immédiate ou à son superviseur immédiat ou à la personne responsable localement qui, immédiatement :\n  1. l’adresse à la représentante ou au représentant de l’employeur autorisé à traiter des griefs au palier approprié,et\n  2. remet à l’auteure ou à l’auteur du grief un reçu indiquant la date à laquelle le grief lui est parvenu.\n33.07Le grief d’une personne salariée n’est pas considéré comme nul du seul fait qu’il n’est pas conforme à la formule fournie par l’employeur.\n33.08Sous réserve de laLoi sur les relations de travail dans le secteur public fédéralet conformément à ses dispositions, l’auteure ou l’auteur du grief qui estime avoir été traité de façon injuste ou qui se considère lésé par une action quelconque ou une absence d’action de la part de l’employeur au sujet de questions autres que celles qui résultent du processus de classification a le droit de présenter un grief de la façon prescrite par au paragraphe 33.06, sauf que :\n  1. dans les cas où il existe une autre procédure administrative prévue par une loi du Parlement ou établie aux termes de cette loi pour traiter de la plainte de l’auteure ou l’auteur du grief, cette procédure doit être suivie,et\n  2. dans les cas où le grief se rattache à l’interprétation ou à l’application de la présente convention collective ou d’une décision arbitrale, une personne salariée n’a pas le droit de présenter le grief à moins d’avoir obtenu l’approbation de l’Institut et de se faire représenter par lui.\n33.09La procédure de règlement des griefs comprend trois (3) paliers au maximum. Ces paliers sont les suivants :\n  1. Palier 1 - premier niveau de direction;\n  2. Palier 2 - palier intermédiaire;\n  3. Palier final – cheffe de la direction ou chef de la direction ou une représentante ou un représentant autorisé.\n33.10L’employeur désigne une représentante ou un représentant à chaque palier de la procédure de règlement des griefs et informe chaque personne salariée qui est assujettie à la procédure du nom ou du titre de la personne ainsi désignée en indiquant en même temps le nom ou le titre et l’adresse de la superviseure immédiate ou du superviseur immédiat ou de la personne responsable localement à qui le grief doit être présenté.\nCette information est communiquée aux personnes salariées au moyen d’avis affichés par l’employeur dans des endroits qui présentent le plus de possibilités d’attirer l’attention des personnes salariées à qui la procédure de règlement des griefs s’applique ou d’une façon qui peut être déterminée par un accord intervenu entre l’employeur et l’Institut.\n33.11Lorsqu’elle présente un grief, la personne salariée qui le désire peut se faire aider et/ou se faire représenter par l’Institut à n’importe quel palier. L’Institut a le droit de tenir des consultations avec l’employeur au sujet d’un grief à chaque ou à n’importe quel palier de la procédure de règlement des griefs.\n33.12L’auteure ou l’auteur du grief peut présenter un grief au premier palier de la procédure de la manière prescrite au paragraphe 33.06, au plus tard le vingt-cinquième (25e) jour qui suit la date à laquelle l’auteure ou l’auteur du grief est informé ou devient conscient de l’action ou des circonstances donnant lieu au grief. L’employeur peut présenter un grief de principe de la manière prescrite au paragraphe 33.04 au plus tard le vingt-cinquième (25e) jour qui suit la date à laquelle il est informé de vive voix ou par écrit ou à laquelle il devient conscient de l’action ou des circonstances donnant lieu au grief de principe.\n33.13L’auteure ou l’auteur du grief peut présenter un grief à chacun des paliers de la procédure de règlement des griefs qui suit le premier :\n  1. lorsque la décision ou la solution ne donne pas satisfaction à l’auteure ou l’auteur du grief dans les dix (10) jours qui suivent la date à laquelle la décision ou la solution lui a été communiquée par écrit par l’employeur,ou\n  2. lorsque l’employeur n’a pas communiqué de décision à l’auteure ou l’auteur du grief au cours du délai prescrit au paragraphe 33.14, dans les quinze (15) jours qui suivent la présentation de son grief au palier précédent.\n33.14À tous les paliers de la procédure de règlement des griefs sauf le dernier, l’employeur répond normalement à un grief dans les dix (10) jours qui suivent la date de présentation du grief et dans les vingt (20) jours lorsque le grief est présenté au dernier palier, sauf dans le cas d’un grief de principe, auquel l’employeur répond normalement dans les trente (30) jours.

De même, l’employeur est jugé avoir livré sa réponse, à quelque palier que ce soit, à la date à laquelle la lettre renfermant la réponse a été oblitérée, mais le délai au cours duquel l’auteure ou l’auteur du grief peut présenter son grief au palier suivant se calcule à partir de la date à laquelle la réponse de l’employeur a été livrée à l’adresse indiquée dans le formulaire de grief.\n33.19Les délais stipulés dans la présente procédure peuvent être prolongés par accord mutuel entre l’employeur et l’auteure ou l’auteur du grief et la représentante ou le représentant de l’Institut dans les cas appropriés, sous réserve des dispositions au paragraphe 33.21.\n33.20Lorsqu’il semble que la nature du grief est telle qu’une décision ne peut être rendue au-dessous d’un palier d’autorité particulier, on peut supprimer un ou l’ensemble des paliers, sauf le dernier, par accord mutuel entre l’employeur et l’auteure ou l’auteur du grief et l’Institut, le cas échéant.\n33.21Lorsque l’employeur rétrograde ou licencie une personne salariée pour un motif déterminé aux termes des alinéas 12(1)c), d) ou e) de laLoi sur la gestion des finances publiques, la procédure de règlement des griefs énoncée dans la présente convention s’applique, sauf que :\n  1. le grief ne peut être présenté qu’au dernier palier,et\n  2. le délai de vingt (20) jours au cours duquel l’employeur doit répondre au dernier palier peut être prolongé jusqu’à un maximum de quarante (40) jours par accord mutuel entre l’employeur et la représentante ou le représentant compétent de l’Institut.\n33.22L’auteure ou l’auteur du grief peut abandonner son grief en adressant un avis écrit à sa superviseure immédiate ou son superviseur immédiat ou à la personne responsable.\n33.23L’auteure ou l’auteur du grief qui ne présente pas son grief au palier suivant dans les délais prescrits est jugé avoir abandonné le grief à moins que, en raison de circonstances indépendantes de sa volonté, elle ou il ait été incapable de respecter les délais prescrits.\n33.24Lorsqu’un grief a été présenté jusqu’au dernier palier inclusivement de la procédure de règlement des griefs relatifs à :\n  1. l’interprétation ou l’application d’une disposition de la présente convention collective ou d’une décision arbitrale s’y rattachant,ou\n  2. un licenciement ou une rétrogradation aux termes des alinéas 12(1)c), d) ou e) de laLoi sur la gestion des finances publiques,ou\n  3. une mesure disciplinaire résultant en une suspension ou une peine pécuniaire,\net que le grief n’a pas été réglé, il peut être présenté à l’arbitrage aux termes des dispositions de laLoi sur les relations de travail dans le secteur public fédéralet de ses règlements d’application.\n33.25Lorsqu’un grief qui peut être présenté à l’arbitrage par une personne salariée se rattache à l’interprétation ou à l’application concernant sa personne d’une disposition de la présente convention ou d’une décision arbitrale, la personne salariée n’a pas le droit de présenter le grief à l’arbitrage à moins que l’Institut ne signifie, de la façon prescrite :\n  1. son approbation du renvoi du grief à l’arbitrage,et\n  2. son accord pour représenter la personne salariée dans la procédure d’arbitrage.\n33.26 Arbitrage accéléré\nLes parties s’entendent que tout grief peut être traité conformément à la procédure d’arbitrage accéléré suivante.\nL’Institut professionnel de la fonction publique du Canada et le Conseil du Trésor conviennent de mettre en œuvre une procédure d’arbitrage accéléré, que les deux (2) parties et la Commission des relations de travail et de l’emploi dans le secteur public fédéral (CRTESPF) pourront passer en revue n’importe quand.

Toutefois, si la rémunération mensuelle de base du poste pour lequel la personne salariée assure un intérim ou pour lequel elle a reçu une affectation temporaire (incluant l’IRC si applicable) est moins élevée que la rémunération mensuelle de base (incluant l’IRC) de son poste d’attache, cette personne salariée continue de toucher l’IRC s’appliquant à son poste d’attache.\n40.04La personne salariée a le droit de recevoir l’IRC conformément au paragraphe 40.01 :\n  1. pendant toute période de congé payé jusqu’à un maximum de soixante (60) jours civils consécutifs;ou\n  2. pendant la période entière de congé payé lorsque la personne salariée bénéficie d’un congé pour accident de travail par suite d’une blessure résultant d’un acte de violence de la part d’une ou de plusieurs détenues ou d’un ou de plusieurs détenus.\n40.05L’IRC ne fait pas partie intégrante de la rémunération de la personne salariée, sauf aux fins des régimes de prestations suivants :\n  • Loi sur la pension de la fonction publique\n  • Régime d’assurance-invalidité de la fonction publique\n  • Régime de pensions du Canada\n  • Régime des rentes du Québec\n  • Assurance-emploi\n  • Loi sur l’indemnisation des agents de l’État\n  • Règlement sur le paiement d’indemnités dans le cas d’accidents d’aviation\n\n### Article 41 : publications et qualité d’auteure ou d’auteur\n41.01L’employeur convient de maintenir l’usage pratiqué dans le passé voulant que les personnes salariées aient facilement accès à toutes les publications que l’employeur juge nécessaires pour leur travail.\n41.02L’employeur convient que tous les articles originaux et les documents professionnels et techniques rédigés par la personne salariée dans le cadre de son travail seront conservés dans les dossiers appropriés du ministère pendant la durée normale de ces dossiers. L’employeur n’interdira pas sans motif valable la publication des articles originaux, des documents professionnels et techniques dans les médias professionnels. À la discrétion de l’employeur, la qualité d’auteure ou d’auteur sera reconnue, dans la mesure du possible, dans les publications du ministère.\n41.03Lorsque la personne salariée agit comme auteure ou auteur unique, comme coauteure ou coauteur ou comme rédactrice ou rédacteur d’une publication originale, sa qualité d’auteure ou d’auteur ou de rédactrice ou de rédacteur figure normalement sur la page de titre de cette publication.\n41.04\n  1. L’employeur peut proposer d’apporter certaines modifications aux documents et peut refuser l’approbation de publier une publication de la personne salariée.\n  2. Lorsque l’approbation d’une publication est refusée, les auteures ou les auteurs doivent en être informés.\n  3. Lorsque l’employeur désire faire des changements dans les documents présentés pour publication et que l’auteure ou l’auteur n’est pas d’accord, à leur demande, leur nom ne sera pas mentionné.\n\n### Article 42 : harcèlement sexuel\n42.01L’Institut et l’employeur reconnaissent le droit des personnes salariées de travailler dans un milieu libre de harcèlement sexuel et ils conviennent que le harcèlement sexuel ne sera pas toléré dans le lieu de travail.\n42.02\n  1. Tout palier de la procédure de règlement des griefs sera supprimé si la personne qui entend le grief est celle qui fait l’objet de la plainte.\n  2. Si, en raison de l’alinéa 42.02a), l’un des paliers de la procédure de règlement des griefs est supprimé, aucun autre palier ne sera supprimé sauf d’un commun accord.\n42.03Sur demande de la partie plaignante ou de la partie intimée et sous réserve de laLoi sur l’accès à l’informationet laLoi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, l’employeur lui remet une copie officielle du rapport d’enquête qui en découle.\n\n### **Article 43 : élimination de la discrimination\n43.01Il n’y aura aucune discrimination, ingérence, restriction, coercition, harcèlement, intimidation, ni aucune mesure disciplinaire exercée ou appliquée à l’égard d’une personne salariée du fait de son âge, sa race, ses croyances, sa couleur, son origine nationale ou ethnique, sa confession religieuse, son sexe, son orientation sexuelle, son identité ou expression de genre, sa situation familiale, son état matrimonial, ses caractéristiques génétiques, son incapacité mentale ou physique, son adhésion à l’Institut ou son activité dans celui-ci ou une condamnation pour laquelle la personne salariée a été graciée ou à l’égard de laquelle une suspension du casier a été ordonnée.\n\n### Article 44 : réaffectation ou congé liés à la grossesse-maternité\n44.01La personne salariée enceinte ou allaitant un enfant peut, pendant la période qui va du début de la grossesse à la fin de la vingt-quatrième (24e) semaine qui suit l’accouchement, demander à l’employeur de modifier ses tâches ou de la réaffecter à un autre poste si, en raison de sa grossesse ou de l’allaitement, la poursuite de ses activités professionnelles courantes peut constituer un risque pour sa santé, celle du fœtus ou celle de l’enfant.\n44.02La demande dont il est question au paragraphe 44.01 est accompagnée d’un certificat médical ou est suivie d’un certificat médical aussitôt que possible faisant état de la durée prévue du risque possible et des activités ou conditions à éviter pour éliminer le risque. Selon les circonstances particulières de la demande, l’employeur peut obtenir un avis médical indépendant.\n44.03La personne salariée peut poursuivre ses activités professionnelles courantes pendant que l’employeur étudie sa demande présentée conformément au paragraphe 44.01; toutefois, si le risque que représentent ses activités professionnelles l’exige, la personne salariée a droit de se faire attribuer immédiatement d’autres tâches jusqu’à ce que l’employeur :\n  1. modifie ses tâches, ou la réaffecte,ou\n  2. l’informe par écrit qu’il est difficilement réalisable de prendre de telles mesures.\n44.04L’employeur, dans la mesure du possible, modifie les tâches de la personne salariée ou la réaffecte.\n44.05Lorsque l’employeur conclut qu’il est difficilement réalisable de modifier les tâches de la personne salariée ou de la réaffecter de façon à éviter les activités ou les conditions mentionnées dans le certificat médical, l’employeur en informe la personne salariée par écrit et lui octroie un congé non payé pendant la période mentionnée dans le certificat médical. Toutefois, ce congé doit se terminer au plus tard vingt-quatre (24) semaines après la naissance.\n44.06Sauf exception valable, la personne salariée qui bénéficie d’une modification des tâches, d’une réaffectation ou d’un congé est tenue de remettre un préavis écrit d’au moins deux (2) semaines à l’employeur de tout changement de la durée prévue du risque ou de l’incapacité que mentionne le certificat médical d’origine.

Pour compenser le nombre d’heures payées ainsi accordé, la personne salariée devra effectuer un nombre équivalent d’heures de travail dans une période de six (6) mois, au moment convenu par l’employeur. Les heures effectuées pour compenser le temps libre accordé en vertu du présent paragraphe ne sont pas rémunérées et ne doivent entraîner aucune dépense additionnelle pour l’employeur.\n46.04La personne salariée qui entend demander un congé ou du temps libre en vertu du présent article doit prévenir l’employeur le plus longtemps d’avance possible et, dans tous les cas, au moins quatre (4) semaines avant le début de la période d’absence demandée.\n\n## Partie 5 : rémunération et durée de la convention\n\n### Article 47 : administration de la rémunération\n47.01Sous réserve du présent article, les conditions régissant l’application de la rémunération aux personnes salariées ne sont pas modifiées par la présente convention.\n47.02La personne salariée a droit de recevoir pour les services qu’elle rend :\n  1. la rémunération indiquée à l’appendice « A » pour la classification du poste auquel elle est nommée, si cette classification est la même que celle qui figure dans son certificat de nomination;ou\n  2. la rémunération indiquée à l’appendice « A » pour la classification qui figure dans son certificat de nomination si cette classification et la classification du poste auquel elle est nommée ne sont pas les mêmes.\n47.03\n  1. Les taux de rémunération indiqués à l’appendice « A » entrent en vigueur aux dates précisées.\n  2. Lorsque les taux de rémunération indiqués à l’appendice « A » entrent en vigueur avant la date de signature de la présente convention, les conditions suivantes s’appliquent :aux fins des sous-alinéas (ii) à (v), l’expression « période de rémunération rétroactive » désigne la période qui commence à la date d’entrée en vigueur de la révision jusqu’à la date précédant la date de signature de la convention ou le jour où la décision arbitrale est rendue à cet égard;la révision rétroactive à la hausse des taux de rémunération s’applique aux personnes salariées, aux anciennes personnes salariées ou, en cas de décès, à la succession des anciennes personnes salariées qui faisaient partie de l’unité de négociation pendant la période de rétroactivité;pour les nominations initiales faites pendant la période de rétroactivité, le taux de rémunération choisi parmi les taux révisés de rémunération est le taux qui figure immédiatement dessous le taux de rémunération reçu avant la révision;pour les promotions, les rétrogradations, les déploiements, les mutations ou les affectations intérimaires qui se produisent durant la période de rétroactivité, le taux de rémunération doit être recalculé, conformément à la Directive sur les conditions d’emploi, en utilisant les taux révisés de rémunération. Si le taux de rémunération recalculé est inférieur au taux de rémunération que la personne salariée recevait auparavant, le taux de rémunération révisé sera le taux qui se rapproche le plus du taux reçu avant la révision, sans y être inférieur. Toutefois, lorsque le taux recalculé se situe à un échelon inférieur de l’échelle, le nouveau taux est le taux de rémunération qui figure immédiatement dessous le taux de rémunération reçu avant la révision;aucun paiement n’est versé et aucun avis n’est donné conformément à l’alinéa 47.03b) pour un montant de un dollar (1 $) ou moins.\n  1. aux fins des sous-alinéas (ii) à (v), l’expression « période de rémunération rétroactive » désigne la période qui commence à la date d’entrée en vigueur de la révision jusqu’à la date précédant la date de signature de la convention ou le jour où la décision arbitrale est rendue à cet égard;\n  2. la révision rétroactive à la hausse des taux de rémunération s’applique aux personnes salariées, aux anciennes personnes salariées ou, en cas de décès, à la succession des anciennes personnes salariées qui faisaient partie de l’unité de négociation pendant la période de rétroactivité;\n  3. pour les nominations initiales faites pendant la période de rétroactivité, le taux de rémunération choisi parmi les taux révisés de rémunération est le taux qui figure immédiatement dessous le taux de rémunération reçu avant la révision;\n  4. pour les promotions, les rétrogradations, les déploiements, les mutations ou les affectations intérimaires qui se produisent durant la période de rétroactivité, le taux de rémunération doit être recalculé, conformément à la Directive sur les conditions d’emploi, en utilisant les taux révisés de rémunération. Si le taux de rémunération recalculé est inférieur au taux de rémunération que la personne salariée recevait auparavant, le taux de rémunération révisé sera le taux qui se rapproche le plus du taux reçu avant la révision, sans y être inférieur. Toutefois, lorsque le taux recalculé se situe à un échelon inférieur de l’échelle, le nouveau taux est le taux de rémunération qui figure immédiatement dessous le taux de rémunération reçu avant la révision;\n  5. aucun paiement n’est versé et aucun avis n’est donné conformément à l’alinéa 47.03b) pour un montant de un dollar (1 $) ou moins.\n47.04Lorsqu’une augmentation d’échelon de rémunération et une révision de rémunération interviennent à la même date, l’augmentation d’échelon de rémunération s’applique d’abord et le taux qui en résulte est révisé conformément à la révision de la rémunération.\n47.05Lorsqu’une personne salariée est tenue par l’employeur de remplir les fonctions d’un poste de classification ou de niveau supérieur à titre intérimaire, pour une période d’au moins trois (3) jours ouvrables consécutifs, elle reçoit une rémunération provisoire, calculée à partir de la date à laquelle elle a commencé son intérim et équivalente à celle qu’elle aurait reçue si elle avait été nommée à ce même niveau de classification supérieur, pour la période au cours de laquelle elle assure l’intérim. Lorsqu’un jour désigné comme jour férié payé survient durant la période de référence, le jour férié est considéré comme jour de travail aux fins de la période de référence.\n47.06\n  1. La période d’augmentation d’échelon de rémunération pour toutes les personnes salariées du niveau IT-01 à IT-05 inclusivement est de douze (12) mois.\n  2.

Dans le cas des personnes salariées nommées avant le 2 décembre 1997, la date anniversaire est la date à laquelle la personne salariée a reçu sa dernière augmentation d’échelon de rémunération.\n47.07En vertu de l’appendice « A », une personne salariée passera, aux dates pertinentes de rajustement des taux de rémunération, de son palier actuel au taux de la nouvelle échelle situé juste en dessous de son taux actuel.\n47.08Le présent article est assujetti au protocole d’accord signé par l’employeur et l’Institut professionnel de la fonction publique du Canada le 21 juillet 1982 à l’égard des personnes salariées dont le poste est bloqué.\n\n### Article 48 : remise en négociation de la convention\n48.01La présente convention peut être modifiée sur consentement mutuel. Si l’une ou l’autre des parties veut modifier la présente convention, elle doit donner à l’autre partie un avis de toute modification proposée et les parties doivent se réunir pour discuter de cette proposition au plus tard un (1) mois civil après la réception d’un tel avis.\n\n### **Article 49 : durée de la convention\n**\n49.01La présente convention collective est conclue pour une durée allant du jour de sa signature au 21 décembre 2025.\n49.02À moins d’indications contraires précises figurant dans le texte, les dispositions de la présente convention entrent en vigueur à la date de sa signature.\n49.03Les deux (2) parties débuteront la période de mise en œuvre de cent vingt (120) jours à compter de la date de signature de la convention collective.\nSignée à Ottawa, le22e jour du mois de décembre 2023.\n\n| Le Conseil du Trésor | L’Institut professionnel de la fonction publique du Canada |\n| --- | --- |\n| Marie-Chantal GirardJanet LeggeNathalie RodrigueAudrey BrousseauStéphane CaronRachel CyrAndrew DaviesMyriam DessureaultAndrew ForbergLauren HunterAnne L’EcuyerRobert PizzutoMarie-Josée Poirier-LeBlancKaren PowerJaspal Sandhu | Jennifer CarrJean-Paul LeducRobert SéguinRob ScottStan BudayMatthew VannerDenis CaissyGurbinder DhillonLucille ShearsMichael VincentPierre A.

La période d’augmentation d’échelons de rémunérations des personnes salariées à temps plein et à temps partiel selon les échelles de taux est de douze (12) mois.\n  2. La personne salariée est rémunérée, aux dates d’effet applicables de rajustement des taux de rémunération, selon la nouvelle échelle de taux indiqué en (A), (W), (B), (X), (C), (Y), (D) ou (Z) juste au-dessous de son ancien taux.\n\n## Appendice « C »\n\n### Dispositions spéciales\nD-1.01La personne salariée qui est tenue de se présenter à bord du navire en partance de son port d’attache en dehors de son horaire de travail habituel et qui n’est pas tenue de travailler à bord quand elle se présente, touche une indemnité égale à une (1) heure de rémunération au taux normal.\n\n### Sinistre maritime\nD-2.01La personne salariée qui exerce des fonctions à bord d’un navire et qui subit la perte de vêtements ou d’autres effets personnels (ceux qu’il est raisonnable que la personne salariée apporte à bord du navire) en raison d’un sinistre maritime ou d’un naufrage est remboursée jusqu’à un maximum de mille dollars (1 000 $) de la valeur de ces effets.\nD-2.02\n  1. La personne salariée doit présenter à l’employeur un inventaire complet de ses effets personnels et doit le tenir à jour.\n  2. La personne salariée, ou sa succession, qui présente une réclamation en vertu du présent article, doit fournir à l’employeur une preuve valable de cette perte ainsi qu’une déclaration signée, faite sous serment, énumérant chaque effet personnel et les valeurs réclamées.\n  3. Les présentes dispositions entreront en vigueur à la date de signature de la convention collective.\n\n## Appendice « D »\n\n### Protocole d’entente de blocage des postes\n\n#### Généralités\n  1. Le présent protocole d’accord établit les conditions d’emplois concernant la rémunération lors d’une reclassification pour toutes les personnes salariées dont l’agent négociateur est l’Institut professionnel de la fonction publique du Canada.\n  2. Le présent protocole d’accord restera en vigueur jusqu’à ce qu’il soit modifié ou annulé par consentement mutuel des parties.\n  3. Le présent protocole d’accord prévaut sur la Directive sur les conditions d’emploi lorsque celle-ci entre en contradiction avec le protocole d’accord.\n  4. Lorsque les dispositions d’une convention collective entrent en conflit avec celles énoncées dans le présent protocole d’accord, ce sont les conditions de ce dernier qui prévalent.\n  5. À compter du 13 décembre 1981, cet accord fera partie intégrante de toutes les conventions collectives auxquelles l’Institut professionnel de la fonction publique du Canada et le Conseil du Trésor seront parties.\n\n#### Partie I\nLa partie I du présent protocole d’accord s’applique aux titulaires de postes qui, après l’entrée en vigueur de ce protocole, seront reclassifiés dans un groupe et/ou un niveau comportant un taux de rémunération maximal accessible inférieur.\nNote : L’expression « taux de rémunération maximal accessible » désigne le taux accessible pour un rendement entièrement satisfaisant dans le cas où les niveaux sont régis par un régime de rémunération au rendement, ou le taux de rémunération maximal dans le cas de tous les autres groupes et niveaux.\n  1. Avant qu’un poste soit reclassifié dans un groupe et/ou un niveau comportant un taux de rémunération maximal accessible inférieur, la ou le titulaire de ce poste doit en être avisé par écrit.\n  2. Nonobstant la reclassification régressive, un poste occupé est réputé avoir conservé, à toutes fins utiles, son ancien groupe et niveau. En ce qui concerne la rémunération de la ou du titulaire, on peut citer cette disposition comme régime de protection salariale et, sous réserve du paragraphe 3b) ci-dessous, elle s’applique jusqu’à ce que le poste devienne vacant ou jusqu’à ce que le taux maximal accessible de l’ancien niveau de classification, révisé de temps à autre, dépasse celui applicable du nouveau niveau, également révisé de temps à autre. Le calcul du taux maximal de rémunération qu’elle ou il peut obtenir sera effectué conformément à la Directive sur les conditions d’emploi.\n  3. L’employeur fera tout effort raisonnable pour muter la ou le titulaire dans un poste d’un niveau équivalent à celui du groupe et/ou du niveau de son ancien poste.Si la ou le titulaire refuse, sans raison valable et suffisante, une offre de mutation dans la même région géographique à un autre poste tel que décrit à l’alinéa a) ci-dessus, elle ou il est immédiatement rémunéré au taux de rémunération du poste reclassifié.\n  4. Les personnes salariées touchées par les dispositions du paragraphe 3 seront réputées avoir été mutées (selon la définition de la Directive sur les conditions d’emploi) aux fins de déterminer les dates d’augmentation d’échelon de salaire et taux de rémunération.\n  1. L’employeur fera tout effort raisonnable pour muter la ou le titulaire dans un poste d’un niveau équivalent à celui du groupe et/ou du niveau de son ancien poste.\n  2. Si la ou le titulaire refuse, sans raison valable et suffisante, une offre de mutation dans la même région géographique à un autre poste tel que décrit à l’alinéa a) ci-dessus, elle ou il est immédiatement rémunéré au taux de rémunération du poste reclassifié.\n\n#### Partie II\nLa partie II du présent protocole d’accord s’applique aux titulaires de postes qui, à la date d’entrée en vigueur de ce protocole, sont rémunérés selon des taux de retenue.\n  1. La personne salariée dont le poste a été déclassé avant la mise en œuvre du présent protocole, qui est rémunérée selon un taux de retenue à la date d’effet d’une augmentation à caractère économique et qui continue d’être rémunérée à ce taux à la date qui précède immédiatement la date d’effet d’une autre augmentation à caractère économique touche une somme forfaitaire équivalente à 100 % de l’augmentation à caractère économique prévue pour son ancien groupe et niveau (ou, lorsqu’elle est assujettie à un régime de rémunération au rendement le rajustement jusqu’au taux de rémunération maximal accessible), ladite somme étant calculée en fonction de son taux de rémunération annuel.\n  2. La personne salariée qui est rémunérée selon un taux de retenue à la date d’effet d’une augmentation à caractère économique, mais qui cesse d’être ainsi rémunérée avant la date d’effet d’une autre augmentation à caractère économique dont le montant est inférieur à celui qu’elle aurait reçu en vertu du paragraphe 1 de la partie II touche une somme forfaitaire égale à la différence entre le montant calculé aux termes du paragraphe 1 de la partie II et toute augmentation de rémunération découlant du fait de ne plus être soumise au taux de retenue.\nSigné à Ottawa, le 21e jour du mois de juillet 1982.\n\n## **Appendice « E »\n\n### Réaménagement des effectifs\n\n#### Table des matières\n  • Généralités**ApplicationConvention collectiveObjectifs**DéfinitionsAutorisationsContrôle**Documents de référence**Demandes de renseignements\n  • Partie I : rôles et responsabilités**1.1 Ministères ou organisations1.2 Secrétariat du Conseil du Trésor1.3 Commission de la fonction publique1.4 Personnes salariées\n  • Partie II : avis officiel**2.1 Ministère ou organisation\n  • Partie III : réinstallation d’une unité de travail**3.1 Généralités\n  • Partie IV : recyclage4.1 Généralités**4.2 Personnes salariées excédentaires**4.3 Personnes mises en disponibilité\n  • Partie V : protection salariale5.1 Poste d’un niveau inférieur\n  • Partie VI : options offertes aux personnes salariées**6.1 Généralités6.2 Programmes de départ volontaire**6.3 Échange de postes**6.4 Options6.5 Prime de maintien en fonction\n  • Partie VII : dispositions particulières concernant la diversification des modes d’exécutionPréambule7.1 Définitions**7.2 Généralités7.3 Responsabilités7.4 Avis concernant la diversification des modes d’exécution7.5 L’offre d’emploi du nouvel employeur**7.6 Application d’autres dispositions de l’appendice7.7 Paiements forfaitaires et suppléments de rémunération7.8 Remboursement7.9 Crédits de congé annuel et indemnité de départ\n  • **Annexe A : énoncé des principes régissant la pension\n  • Annexe B : mesure de soutien à la transition\n  • **Annexe C : rôle de la CFP dans l’administration des droits de propriété des personnes salariées excédentaires et des personnes mises en disponibilité\n  • **Application\n  • Convention collective\n  • Objectifs\n  • **Définitions\n  • Autorisations\n  • Contrôle\n  • **Documents de référence\n  • **Demandes de renseignements\n  • **1.1 Ministères ou organisations\n  • 1.2 Secrétariat du Conseil du Trésor\n  • 1.3 Commission de la fonction publique\n  • 1.4 Personnes salariées\n  • **2.1 Ministère ou organisation\n  • **3.1 Généralités\n  • 4.1 Généralités\n  • **4.2 Personnes salariées excédentaires\n  • **4.3 Personnes mises en disponibilité\n  • 5.1 Poste d’un niveau inférieur\n  • **6.1 Généralités\n  • 6.2 Programmes de départ volontaire\n  • **6.3 Échange de postes\n  • **6.4 Options\n  • 6.5 Prime de maintien en fonction\n  • Préambule\n  • 7.1 Définitions\n  • **7.2 Généralités\n  • 7.3 Responsabilités\n  • 7.4 Avis concernant la diversification des modes d’exécution\n  • 7.5 L’offre d’emploi du nouvel employeur\n  • **7.6 Application d’autres dispositions de l’appendice\n  • 7.7 Paiements forfaitaires et suppléments de rémunération\n  • 7.8 Remboursement\n  • 7.9 Crédits de congé annuel et indemnité de départ\n\n#### Généralités\n\n##### Application\n**\nLe présent appendice s’applique à toutes les personnes salariées nommées pour une période indéterminée.\nÀ moins qu’il ne soit spécifiquement indiqué, les parties I à VI ne s’appliquent pas à la diversification des modes d’exécution.\n\n##### Convention collective\nÀ l’exception des dispositions dont la Commission de la fonction publique (CFP) est chargée, le présent appendice fait partie de la présente convention collective.\n\n##### Objectifs\nLe Conseil du Trésor a pour politique d’optimiser les possibilités d’emploi pour les personnes salariées nommées pour une période indéterminée en situation de réaménagement des effectifs, en s’assurant que, dans toute la mesure du possible, on offre à ces personnes salariées d’autres possibilités d’emploi. On ne doit toutefois pas considérer que le présent appendice assure le maintien dans un poste en particulier, mais plutôt le maintien d’emploi.\nÀ cette fin, les personnes salariées nommées pour une période indéterminée et dont les services ne seront plus requis en raison d’un réaménagement des effectifs et pour lesquels l’administratrice générale ou l’administrateur général sait ou peut prévoir la disponibilité d’emploi se verront garantir qu’une offre d’emploi raisonnable dans l’administration publique centrale leur sera faite. Les personnes salariées pour lesquelles l’administratrice générale ou l’administrateur général ne peut faire de garantie pourront bénéficier des arrangements d’emploi, ou formules de transition (parties VI et VII).\n\n##### Définitions\n**\nUn échange a lieu lorsqu’une personne salariée optante (non excédentaire) ou une personne salariée excédentaire qui est excédentaire parce qu’elle a choisi l’option 6.4.1 (a) qui préférerait rester dans l’administration publique centrale échange son poste avec une personne salariée non touchée (la personne salariée remplaçante) qui désire quitter l’administration publique centrale avec une mesure de soutien à la transition (MST) ou une indemnité d’études.\n**\nUne des options offertes à une personne salariée nommée pour une période indéterminée touchée par une situation de réaménagement des effectifs et à qui l’administratrice générale ou l’administrateur général ne peut garantir une offre d’emploi raisonnable. L’indemnité d’études est un montant forfaitaire équivalant à la MST (voir l’annexe B), plus le remboursement des frais de scolarité d’un établissement d’enseignement reconnu et des frais de livres et d’équipement pertinents, jusqu’à un maximum de dix-sept mille dollars (17 000 $).\nOffre d’emploi pour une période indéterminée dans l’administration publique centrale, habituellement à un niveau équivalent, sans que soient exclues les offres d’emploi à des niveaux plus bas. La personne salariée excédentaire doit être mobile et recyclable. Dans la mesure du possible, la recherche d’une offre d’emploi jugée raisonnable s’effectuera comme suit : 1) dans la zone d’affectation de la personne salariée, selon la définition de la Directive sur les voyages; 2) dans un rayon de quarante kilomètres (40 km) du lieu de travail ou du lieu de résidence de la personne salariée, compte tenu de l’option la mieux susceptible d’assurer une continuité en matière d’emploi, et 3) à l’extérieur du rayon de quarante kilomètres (40 km). Pour les situations de diversification des modes d’exécution, une offre d’emploi est jugée raisonnable si elle satisfait aux critères établis aux catégories 1 et 2 de la partie VII du présent appendice. Une offre d’emploi raisonnable est aussi une offre d’emploi d’un employeur de l’annexe V de la LGFP, pourvu que :\n  1. la nomination soit à un taux de rémunération et dans une échelle dont le maximum atteignable ne soit pas inférieur au taux de rémunération et au maximum atteignable de la personne salariée en vigueur à la date de l’offre;\n  2. ce soit un transfert sans interruption de tous les avantages sociaux de la personne salariée, incluant la reconnaissance de ses années de service aux fins du calcul de l’emploi continu ainsi que l’accumulation des avantages, y compris le transfert des crédits de congé de maladie, de l’indemnité de départ et des crédits de congé annuel accumulés.\n**\n**\nPriorité dont bénéficient les personnes mises en disponibilité, accordée en vertu du paragraphe 41(4) de la LEFP, pour tout poste pour lequel la CFP est convaincue que la personne rencontre les qualifications essentielles. La période d’admissibilité à cette priorité est définie sous leRèglement sur l’emploi dans la fonction publique(REFP).\n**\nPriorité de nomination accordée, conformément au paragraphe 10(1) duRèglement sur l’emploi dans la fonction publique, à certaines personnes salariées dont le traitement est protégé en vertu du présent appendice, afin de les aider à obtenir une nomination à un niveau équivalant à celui qu’elles occupaient avant d’être déclarées excédentaires.\n**\n\n##### Autorisations\nLa CFP accepte les sections du présent appendice qui relèvent de sa compétence.\n\n##### Contrôle\nLes ministères ou les organisations conservent à un endroit central des renseignements sur tous les cas visés par le présent appendice, et qui portent notamment sur ce qui suit : les raisons de la mesure; le nombre, le groupe professionnel et le niveau des personnes salariées en cause; la date où l’avis a été donné; le nombre de personnes salariées placées sans recyclage; le nombre de personnes salariées recyclées (y compris le nombre de mois de salaire utilisés pour le recyclage); le niveau des postes auxquels les personnes salariées ont été nommées et le coût de toute protection salariale; et, le nombre, le type et le montant des paiements forfaitaires versés aux personnes salariées.\nLe Secrétariat du Conseil du Trésor (SCT) se sert de ces renseignements pour faire ses vérifications périodiques.\n\n##### Documents de référence\nLes principaux documents de référence ayant trait au réaménagement des effectifs sont les suivants :\n**\n  • Loi sur la gestion des finances publiques\n  • Code de valeurs et d’éthique du secteur public\n  • Loi sur l’emploi dans la fonction publique\n  • Règlement sur l’emploi dans la fonction publique\n  • Loi sur les relations de travail dans le secteur public fédéral\n  • Loi sur la pension de la fonction publique\n  • Directive sur les conditions d’emploi\n  • Directive sur la réinstallation du CNM\n  • Directive sur les voyages\n\n##### Demandes de renseignements\nLes demandes de renseignements relatives au présent appendice doivent être adressées à l’Institut ou aux agentes et agents responsables à l’administration centrale du ministère ou de l’organisation en cause.\n**\nLes agentes et agents responsables doivent renvoyer les questions portant sur l’application de l’appendice à la directrice principale ou au directeur principal, Participation des syndicats et soutien du Conseil national mixte, Secteur des relations avec les employés et de la rémunération globale, SCT.\nLes demandes des personnes salariées pour des renseignements touchant leur priorité de nomination ou leur situation dans le cadre du processus de nomination prioritaire doivent être faites à la conseillère ou au conseiller en ressources humaines de leur ministère ou organisation ou à la conseillère ou au conseiller sur les priorités de la CFP responsable de leur dossier.\n\n#### Partie I : rôles et responsabilités\n\n##### 1.1 Ministères ou organisations\n1.1.1Étant donné que les personnes salariées nommées pour une période indéterminée qui sont touchées par un réaménagement des effectifs ne sont pas elles-mêmes responsables de cette situation, il incombe aux ministères ou aux organisations de veiller à ce qu’elles soient traitées équitablement et à ce qu’on leur offre toutes les possibilités raisonnables de poursuivre leur carrière dans la fonction publique.\n1.1.2Les ministères ou les organisations réalisent une planification efficace des ressources humaines afin de réduire au minimum les répercussions d’un réaménagement des effectifs sur les personnes salariées nommées pour une période indéterminée, sur le ministère ou l’organisation et sur la fonction publique.\n1.1.3Les ministères ou les organisations :\n  1. établissent, au besoin, des comités mixtes chargés de fournir des avis et de mener des consultations au sujet du réaménagement de leurs effectifs,et\n  2. avisent l’IPFPC des agentes et agents responsables de l’administration du présent appendice.\nLe mandat de ces comités prévoit un mécanisme pour traiter les demandes d’échange de postes provenant d’autres ministères et organismes.\n1.1.4Les ministères ou les organisations d’attache collaborent avec la CFP et avec les ministères ou les organisations d’accueil pour réaffecter leurs personnes salariées excédentaires et leurs personnes mises en disponibilité.\n1.1.5Les ministères ou les organisations établissent des systèmes facilitant la réaffectation ou le recyclage de leurs personnes salariées touchées et excédentaires et de leurs personnes mises en disponibilité.\n1.1.6Lorsqu’une administratrice générale ou un administrateur général conclut que les services d’une personne salariée ne seront plus requis après une certaine date en raison d’un manque de travail ou de la suppression d’une fonction, elle ou il en informe ladite personne salariée par écrit. Une copie de cette lettre doit être immédiatement acheminée à la présidente ou au président de l’IPFPC.\nLa lettre doit indiquer si :\n  1. une garantie d’offre d’emploi raisonnable est faite par l’administratrice générale ou l’administrateur général et que la personne salariée est déclarée excédentaire à compter de la date précisée;ou\n  2. la personne salariée est déclarée optante et peut bénéficier des options offertes au paragraphe 6.4 du présent appendice, car l’administratrice générale ou l’administrateur général ne peut garantir une offre d’emploi raisonnable.\nLe cas échéant, la lettre doit aussi préciser la date éventuelle de mise en disponibilité.\n1.1.7Normalement, l’administratrice générale ou l’administrateur général garantira une offre d’emploi raisonnable à la personne salariée assujettie au réaménagement des effectifs pour laquelle elle ou il sait ou peut prévoir une disponibilité d’emploi dans l’administration publique centrale.\n1.1.8Si l’administratrice générale ou l’administrateur général ne peut garantir une offre d’emploi raisonnable, elle ou il doit donner cent vingt (120) jours à la personne salariée optante pour examiner les trois (3) options expliquées à la partie VI du présent appendice et prendre une décision. Si la personne salariée ne fait pas de choix, elle sera réputée avoir choisi l’option 6.4.1 (a), une priorité de personne salariée excédentaire de douze (12) mois pour trouver une offre d’emploi raisonnable.\n1.1.9Sur demande d’une personne salariée touchée nommée pour une période indéterminée qui peut démontrer que ses tâches n’existent déjà plus, l’administratrice générale ou l’administrateur général doit décider de garantir une offre d’emploi raisonnable ou d’offrir les options du paragraphe 6.4 du présent appendice à la personne salariée.\n1.1.10Le ministère ou l’organisation informe par écrit la CFP du statut d’excédentaire de la personne salariée et lui transmet les détails, les formulaires, les curriculum vitæ et toute autre information que la CFP pourra lui demander pour qu’elle puisse s’acquitter de sa tâche.\n1.1.11Le ministère ou l’organisation d’attache fournit à la CFP une déclaration écrite dans laquelle il précise qu’il serait prêt à nommer la personne salariée excédentaire à un poste qui convienne à ses qualifications si un tel poste était disponible.\n1.1.12Les ministères ou les organisations informent la présidente ou le président de l’IPFPC et consultent les représentantes ou les représentants de l’Institut de façon exhaustive au sujet de tout réaménagement des effectifs le plus tôt possible après que la décision a été prise et tout au long du processus. Dès que les personnes salariées touchées sont connues, les ministères ou les organisations font immédiatement part à la présidente ou au président de l’Institut de leur nom, lieu de travail, numéro de téléphone, adresse courriel et adresse postale, tels qu’ils figurent dans la base de données ministérielle ou organisationnelle sur les personnes salariées.\n1.1.13Les ministères ou les organisations informent officiellement les personnes salariées qu’elles font l’objet d’une mesure de réaménagement des effectifs et rappellent à la personne salariée que l’appendice « F » sur le réaménagement des effectifs de la présente convention collective s’applique.\n1.1.14Les administratrices générales ou administrateurs généraux appliquent le présent appendice de façon à ce que le nombre de mises en disponibilité involontaires soit le moins élevé possible. Les mises en disponibilité ne doivent normalement se produire que lorsqu’une personne salariée a refusé une offre d’emploi raisonnable, qu’elle n’est pas mobile, qu’elle ne peut pas être recyclée en moins de deux (2) ans ou qu’elle demande à être mise en disponibilité.\n1.1.15Les ministères ou les organisations doivent conseiller et renseigner leurs personnes salariées touchées au sujet des possibilités de poursuivre leur carrière au sein de la fonction publique et doivent, dans la mesure du possible, faire la promotion des personnes salariées excédentaires et des personnes mises en disponibilité auprès d’autres ministères ou organisations, à moins que ces personnes ne soient averties par écrit par le ministère ou l’organisation qu’elles ne sont pas disponibles aux fins de nomination.\n1.1.16La nomination de personnes salariées excédentaires à d’autres postes, avec ou sans recyclage, se fait normalement à un niveau équivalant à celui qu’elles occupaient au moment où elles ont été déclarées excédentaires, mais elle peut aussi se faire à un niveau moins élevé. Les ministères ou les organisations évitent de nommer les personnes salariées excédentaires à un niveau inférieur, sauf s’ils ont épuisé toutes les autres possibilités.\n1.1.17Les ministères ou les organisations d’attache nomment le plus grand nombre de leurs personnes salariées excédentaires ou de leurs personnes mises en disponibilité ou trouvent d’autres postes (vacants ou devant le devenir) pour lesquels les personnes concernées peuvent être recyclées.\n1.1.18Les ministères ou les organisations d’attache réinstallent leurs personnes salariées excédentaires et leurs personnes mises en disponibilité, si c’est nécessaire.\n1.1.19Les personnes salariées excédentaires et les personnes mises en disponibilité sont réinstallées si elles déclarent être disposées à l’être et si cette réinstallation leur permet d’être réaffectées ou d’être nommées à un autre poste, à condition :\n  1. qu’il n’y ait aucune ou aucun bénéficiaire de priorité ou aucune ou aucun bénéficiaire d’une priorité supérieure qui possède les compétences requises et qui soit intéressée ou intéressé par le poste à pourvoir;ou\n  2. qu’il n’y ait localement aucune personne salariée excédentaire ou aucune personne mise en disponibilité qui soit intéressée par le poste et qui pourrait acquérir les compétences requises grâce au recyclage.\n1.1.20Le ministère ou l’organisation d’attache de la personne salariée assume les frais de déplacement engagés par la personne concernée pour se rendre à des entrevues, ainsi que ses frais de réinstallation. Ces frais sont remboursés à la personne concernée conformément aux directives sur les voyages et sur la réinstallation du CNM.\n1.1.21Aux fins de la Directive sur la réinstallation du CNM, les personnes salariées excédentaires et les personnes mises en disponibilité qui sont réinstallées conformément au présent appendice sont réputées être des personnes salariées réinstallées à la demande de l’employeur. La règle générale ayant trait à la distance minimale exigée pour une réinstallation s’applique dans leur cas.\n1.1.22Aux fins de la Directive sur les voyages, les personnes mises en disponibilité qui se déplacent pour se rendre à des entrevues en vue d’une éventuelle nomination dans l’administration publique centrale sont réputées être un « voyageur » selon la définition de la Directive sur les voyages.\n1.1.23Pour la période de priorité et/ou de mises en disponibilité, les ministères ou les organisations d’attache prennent à leur charge le traitement, les frais liés à la protection salariale et/ou à la cessation d’emploi, ainsi que les autres frais autorisés, comme les frais de scolarité, de déplacement, de réinstallation et de recyclage de leurs personnes salariées excédentaires et de leurs personnes mises en disponibilité, en conformité avec la présente convention collective et les diverses directives applicables. Le ministère ou l’organisation d’accueil peut accepter d’assumer la totalité ou une partie de ces frais.\n1.1.24Lorsqu’une personne salariée excédentaire est nommée par un autre ministère ou une autre organisation à un poste pour une période déterminée, ces frais sont imputés au ministère ou à l’organisation d’attache pendant une période d’un an suivant la date de la nomination, à moins que les ministères ou les organisations d’attache et d’accueil ne s’entendent sur une période plus longue, après quoi le ministère ou l’organisation d’accueil devient le nouveau ministère ou la nouvelle organisation d’attache de la personne salariée, conformément aux pouvoirs dévolus à la CFP.\n1.1.25Les ministères ou les organisations protègent le statut de personne salariée nommée pour une période indéterminée et de bénéficiaire de priorité des personnes salariées excédentaires nommées à un poste pour une période déterminée en vertu du présent appendice.\n**\n1.1.26Les ministères ou les organisations informent la CFP en temps opportun et par une méthode recommandée par la CFP, des résultats de toutes les présentations qui leur sont faites en vertu du présent appendice. De plus, les ministères ou les organisations donnent de la rétroaction aux personnes salariées excédentaires et aux personnes mises en disponibilité lorsqu’elles n’obtiennent pas le poste pour lequel elles ont été référées.\n1.1.27Les ministères ou les organisations examinent leur utilisation de personnel temporaire d’agence, d’entrepreneures, d’entrepreneurs, de conseillères, de conseillers, et l’utilisation de services de sous-traitance, de personnes salariées nommées pour une période déterminée et de toutes les autres personnes salariées nommées pour une période autre qu’indéterminée; dans la mesure du possible, ils évitent d’embaucher et de réembaucher le personnel temporaire d’agence, les entrepreneures, les entrepreneurs, les services de sous-traitance, les conseillères, les conseillers ou les autres personnes susmentionnées si cela est de nature à faciliter la nomination de personnes salariées excédentaires ou de personnes mises en disponibilité.\n1.1.28Rien de ce qui précède ne limite le droit de l’employeur d’embaucher ou de nommer des personnes pour répondre à des besoins ponctuels à court terme. Les personnes salariées excédentaires et les personnes mises en disponibilité ont la priorité même pour ces emplois de courte durée.\n1.1.29Les ministères ou les organisations peuvent mettre une personne salariée excédentaire en disponibilité à une date antérieure à la date prévue, quand celle-ci le leur demande par écrit.\n1.1.30Les ministères ou les organisations agissant à titre de ministère ou d’organisation d’accueil collaborent avec la CFP et les autres ministères ou organisations en acceptant de nommer ou de recycler, dans la mesure du possible, le plus grand nombre possible de personnes salariées touchées ou excédentaires et de personnes mises en disponibilité d’autres ministères ou organisations.\n1.1.31Les ministères ou les organisations donnent aux personnes salariées excédentaires un avis de mise en disponibilité au moins un (1) mois avant la date prévue, si les efforts faits en vue de les nommer ont été vains. Une copie de cet avis est transmise à la présidente ou au président de l’IPFPC.\n1.1.32Si une personne salariée excédentaire refuse une offre d’emploi raisonnable, elle sera susceptible d’être mise en disponibilité un mois après le refus de l’offre. Toutefois, la mise en disponibilité ne peut se faire avant six (6) mois suivant la date de l’avis d’excédentaire. Les dispositions du paragraphe 1.3.3 continuent de s’appliquer.\n1.1.33Les ministères ou les organisations doivent présumer que les personnes salariées désirent être réaffectées à moins qu’elles n’indiquent le contraire par écrit.\n1.1.34Les ministères ou les organisations fournissent aux personnes salariées touchées ou excédentaires une orientation et des renseignements complets le plus tôt possible après que la décision de les déclarer excédentaires ou touchées soit prise, et tout au long du processus, en affectant à cette fin une personne-ressource à chacune d’elles ainsi qu’à une personne salariée optante. L’orientation comprend la prestation d’explications et d’aide en ce qui concerne :\n**\n  1. le réaménagement des effectifs et ses conséquences sur la personne concernée;\n  2. l’appendice sur le réaménagement des effectifs;\n  3. le système de gestion de l’information sur les priorités de la CFP et la façon dont il fonctionne, du point de vue de la personne salariée;\n  4. l’établissement d’un curriculum vitæ;\n  5. les droits et les obligations de la personne salariée;\n  6. la situation actuelle de la personne salariée (par exemple, la rémunération, les avantages sociaux tels que l’indemnité de départ et la pension de retraite, la classification, les droits linguistiques, les années de service);\n  7. les autres possibilités offertes à la personne salariée (processus d’échange de postes, nomination, réinstallation, recyclage, emploi à un niveau inférieur, emploi pour une période déterminée, retraite, y compris la possibilité d’être exemptée de la pénalité si elle a droit à une allocation annuelle, mesure de soutien à la transition, indemnité d’études, la rémunération en remplacement de la période excédentaire, démission, mise en disponibilité accélérée);\n  8. les chances de nomination de la personne salariée à un autre poste;\n  9. la signification des expressions « garantie d’offre d’emploi raisonnable », « une priorité de personne salariée excédentaire d’une durée de douze (12) mois pour trouver une offre d’emploi raisonnable »; « MST »; « indemnité d’études »;\n  10. les options pour les personnes salariées ne disposant pas d’une garantie d’offre d’emploi raisonnable, la période d’examen de cent vingt (120) jours assortie de l’accès au processus d’échange de postes;\n  11. aviser les personnes salariées de se renseigner à propos des échanges de postes proposés et de soumettre une demande d’approbation dans les plus brefs délais une fois informées qu’elles ne recevront pas une garantie d’offre d’emploi raisonnable;\n  12. les Centres de ressources humaines Canada et leurs services (y compris la recommandation que la personne salariée s’inscrive le plus tôt possible au bureau le plus proche);\n  13. la préparation aux entrevues avec d’éventuels employeurs;\n  14. la poursuite de l’orientation aussi longtemps que la personne concernée a droit à la priorité en matière de dotation et qu’elle n’a pas été nommée à un poste;\n  15. un avertissement selon lequel, si la personne salariée refuse une offre d’emploi raisonnable, cela nuira à ses chances d’être recyclée et de continuer à être employée;\n  16. aviser les personnes salariées de leur droit d’être représentées par l’Institut en ce qui concerne l’application du présent appendice;et\n**\n  1. Le programme d’aide aux personnes salariées.\n1.1.35Lorsque c’est nécessaire pour faciliter la nomination des personnes salariées, les ministères ou les organisations d’attache établissent un plan de recyclage, le signent et le font signer par les personnes salariées en cause et par les ministères ou les organisations d’accueil.\n1.1.36L’indemnité de départ et les autres avantages sociaux prévus par d’autres clauses de la présente convention collective sont distincts de ceux qui sont offerts dans le présent appendice, et ils s’y ajoutent.\n1.1.37La personne salariée excédentaire qui démissionne dans le contexte du présent appendice est réputée avoir été mise en disponibilité par l’employeur à la date à laquelle l’administratrice générale ou l’administrateur général accepte par écrit sa démission, aux fins du calcul de l’indemnité de départ et de la rémunération rétroactive.\n1.1.38Le ministère ou l’organisation examinera la situation de chaque personne salariée touchée chaque année, ou plus tôt, à partir de la date de l’avis initial l’informant de son statut de personne salariée touchée et déterminera si la personne salariée doit conserver ou non son statut de personne salariée touchée.\n1.1.39Le ministère ou l’organisation avisera la personne salariée touchée, par écrit, dans les cinq (5) jours ouvrables de la décision prise en vertu du paragraphe 1.1.38.\n\n##### 1.2 Secrétariat du Conseil du Trésor (SCT)\n1.2.1Il incombe au SCT :\n  1. d’examiner et de régler les cas soumis par la CFP ou par d’autres parties,et\n  2. d’examiner les demandes de ressources présentées par les ministères ou les organisations aux fins du recyclage,et\n  3. veiller à ce que les ministères ou les organisations soient informés dans la mesure du possible des professions où il y a des pénuries de compétence.\n\n##### 1.3 Commission de la fonction publique (CFP)\n1.3.1Dans le contexte du réaménagement des effectifs et de la loi régissant la CFP, il incombe à la CFP de :\n  1. veiller au respect des droits de priorité;\n  2. s’assurer que des mesures sont prises pour évaluer les compétences des personnes ayant droit à une priorité à occuper les postes vacants et à les nommer si elles ont les qualifications essentielles du poste;et\n  3. s’assurer que les personnes ayant droit à une priorité sont informées de leurs droits à ce chapitre.\n1.3.2La CFP fournira, conformément à laLoi sur la protection des renseignements personnels:\n  1. au SCT les renseignements relatifs à l’administration des droits de priorité qui pourraient influer sur le niveau de conformité des ministères ou des organisations au présent appendice;et\n  2. des renseignements à l’Institut sur le nombre et la situation de leurs membres inscrites ou inscrits dans le Système de gestion de l’information sur les priorités, de même que des renseignements sur l’ensemble du système.\n1.3.3Les rôles et responsabilités de la CFP découlent de la loi qui la régit, non pas de la convention collective. À ce titre, toute modification apportée à ces rôles/responsabilités doit être approuvée par la CFP. Pour obtenir davantage de détails sur le rôle de la CFP dans l’administration des droits de priorité des personnes salariées excédentaires et des personnes mises en disponibilité, consultez l’annexe C du présent appendice.\n\n##### 1.4 Personnes salariées\n1.4.1Les personnes salariées ont le droit d’être représentées par l’IPFPC en ce qui concerne l’application du présent appendice.\n1.4.2Il incombe aux personnes salariées directement touchées par un réaménagement des effectifs, qui reçoivent une garantie d’offre d’emploi raisonnable ou qui choisissent, ou qui sont réputées avoir choisi, l’option 6.4.1 (a) de la partie VI du présent appendice :\n  1. de chercher activement un autre emploi, en collaboration avec leur ministère ou leur organisation et avec la CFP, à moins qu’elles n’aient informé ceux-ci par écrit de leur non-disponibilité aux fins d’une nomination;\n  2. de se renseigner sur leurs droits et obligations;\n  3. de fournir promptement au ministère ou à l’organisation d’attache et à la CFP les renseignements (dont un curriculum vitæ) qui les aideront dans leurs démarches en vue d’une nomination;\n  4. de s’assurer que la CFP et les ministères ou les organisations d’accueil peuvent les joindre facilement, et de se présenter à tout rendez-vous découlant d’une présentation;\n  5. d’étudier sérieusement les possibilités d’emploi qui leur sont offertes (c’est-à-dire les présentations au sein du ministère ou de l’organisation d’attache, les présentations de la CFP et les offres d’emploi faites par des ministères ou des organisations), y compris celles qui prévoient un recyclage ou une réinstallation, ainsi que les nominations pour une période déterminée et les nominations à un niveau inférieur.\n1.4.3Les personnes salariées optantes doivent :\n  1. envisager les options faites à la partie VI du présent appendice;\n  2. faire connaître, par écrit, l’option choisie à leur gestionnaire au plus tard cent vingt (120) jours après déclaration de leur statut de personne salariée optante;et\n  3. soumettre leur demande d’échange de postes à la gestion avant l’échéance de la période de cent vingt (120) jours, lorsque l’échange de postes est avec une personne salariée non touchée.\n\n#### Partie II : avis officiel\n\n##### 2.1 Ministère ou organisation\n2.1.1Tel que déjà mentionné au paragraphe 1.1.12, les ministères ou les organisations informent et consultent les représentantes et les représentants de l’Institut de façon exhaustive dans les cas de réaménagement des effectifs, le plus tôt possible après qu’une décision a été prise et tout au long du processus. Ils communiqueront à l’Institut et à la présidente ou au président de l’IPFPC, le nom, le lieu de travail, le numéro de téléphone, l’adresse courriel, et l’adresse postale des personnes salariées touchées, tels qu’il figure dans la base de données ministérielle ou organisationnelle sur les personnes salariées.\n**\n2.1.2Dans tous les cas de réaménagement des effectifs susceptibles de toucher au moins six (6) personnes salariées nommées pour une période indéterminée visées par le présent appendice, le ministère ou l’organisation responsable informe confidentiellement et par écrit le SCT, le plus tôt possible, et jamais moins de quatre (4) jours ouvrables avant l’annonce du réaménagement.\n2.1.3Avant d’aviser une personne salariée potentiellement touchée, les ministères ou les organisations doivent aviser la présidente ou le président de l’Institut dont des membres sont touchés. Un tel avis doit être fait par écrit, de façon confidentielle et le plus rapidement possible et en aucun cas moins de deux (2) jours ouvrables avant qu’une personne salariée soit avisée du réaménagement des effectifs. Un tel avis doit indiquer le nom et le lieu de l’unité touchée ou des unités de travail touchées, la date prévue de l’annonce, le moment prévu du réaménagement des effectifs et le nombre, le groupe et le niveau des personnes salariées qui seront vraisemblablement touchées par la décision.\n\n#### Partie III : réinstallation d’une unité de travail\n\n##### 3.1 Généralités\n3.1.1Dans les cas où une unité de travail est réinstallée, les ministères ou les organisations offrent à toutes les personnes salariées dont le poste sera transféré par avis écrit le choix d’être réinstallées avec ladite unité ou d’être considérées comme des personnes salariées visées par une situation de réaménagement des effectifs.\n**\n3.1.2Après avoir reçu un avis par écrit à cet effet, les personnes salariées disposent d’une période de six (6) mois pour préciser leur intention d’être réinstallées avec le poste. Si l’intention de la personne salariée est de ne pas être réinstallée avec le poste, l’administratrice générale ou l’administrateur général, après avoir tenu compte de tous les facteurs pertinents, peut soit garantir une offre d’emploi raisonnable à la personne salariée ou lui offrir les options du paragraphe 6.4 du présent appendice.\n3.1.3Les personnes salariées transférées avec leur unité de travail sont traitées conformément aux dispositions des paragraphes 1.1.18 à 1.1.22.\n**\n3.1.4Les ministères ou les organisations s’efforceront de respecter les préférences d’installation de la personne salariée, mais rien n’empêche une administratrice générale ou un administrateur général, après une consultation et un examen de chaque situation avec le SCT, d’offrir le poste réinstallé avec l’unité de travail à une personne salariée à qui l’administratrice générale ou l’administrateur général garantit une offre d’emploi raisonnable, après avoir pris tout le temps que le permettent les activités générales pour trouver une offre d’emploi raisonnable dans la zone d’installation voulue de la personne salariée.\n3.1.5La personne salariée qui ne reçoit pas une garantie d’offre d’emploi raisonnable sera déclarée optante et sera admissible aux options présentées à la partie VI du présent appendice.\n\n#### Partie IV : recyclage\n\n##### 4.1 Généralités\n4.1.1Pour faciliter la réaffectation des personnes salariées touchées, des personnes salariées excédentaires et des personnes mises en disponibilité, les ministères ou les organisations doivent faire tous les efforts raisonnables pour les recycler en vue d’une nomination :\n  1. à un poste vacant;ou\n  2. à des postes censés devenir vacants, d’après les prévisions de la direction.\n4.1.2La personne salariée, le ministère ou l’organisation d’attache et le ministère ou l’organisation d’accueil sont chargés de repérer les possibilités de recyclage conformément aux dispositions du paragraphe 4.1.1.\n4.1.3Sous réserve des dispositions du paragraphe 4.1.2, l’administratrice générale ou l’administrateur général du ministère ou de l’organisation d’attache approuve une période de recyclage d’une durée maximale de deux (2) ans.\n\n##### 4.2 Personnes salariées excédentaires\n4.2.1La personne salariée excédentaire a droit au recyclage, pourvu :\n  1. que cela facilite sa nomination à un poste vacant donné ou lui permette de se qualifier pour des vacances prévues dans des emplois ou endroits où il y a pénurie de compétences;et\n  2. qu’aucune ou aucun autre bénéficiaire de priorité n’ait les qualifications requises pour un poste vacant donné auquel il est fait référence à l’alinéa a) ci-dessus.\n**\n4.2.2Le ministère ou l’organisation d’attache s’assure qu’un plan de recyclage approprié est préparé et qu’il est signé par la personne salariée excédentaire, par ses propres agentes ou agents délégués et par celles ou ceux du ministère ou de l’organisation d’accueil. Le ministère ou l’organisation d’attache est aussi responsable d’informer la personne salariée, en temps opportun, si une proposition de recyclage soumise par la personne salariée n’est pas approuvée. À la demande de la personne salariée, une rétroaction écrite portant sur la décision, y compris la raison pour laquelle le recyclage n’a pas été approuvé, lui sera fourni.\n**\n4.2.3Une fois le plan de recyclage mis en œuvre, il se poursuit à condition que le rendement de la personne salariée soit satisfaisant. Les ministères ou organisations doivent fournir régulièrement à la personne salariée des renseignements par écrit sur l’avancement du plan de recyclage.\n4.2.4Pendant son recyclage, la personne salariée excédentaire continue d’être employée par le ministère ou l’organisation d’attache et d’être rémunérée d’après son poste, à moins que le ministère ou l’organisation d’accueil ne soit disposé à la nommer pour une période indéterminée, à condition qu’elle mène son recyclage à bonne fin, auquel cas le plan de recyclage doit être inclus dans la lettre d’offre.\n4.2.5Lorsqu’un plan de recyclage a été approuvé, et que la personne salariée excédentaire continue d’être employée par le ministère ou l’organisation d’attache, la date de mise en disponibilité envisagée est reportée jusqu’à la fin de la période de recyclage, sous réserve du paragraphe 4.2.3.\n4.2.6La personne salariée qui ne mène pas son recyclage à bonne fin peut être mise en disponibilité à la fin de sa période de priorité d’excédentaire si l’employeur ne réussit pas à lui faire une offre d’emploi raisonnable.\n4.2.7Outre les autres droits et avantages accordés en vertu de la présente partie, la personne salariée excédentaire qui se voit garantir une offre d’emploi raisonnable et qui consent à être réinstallée se voit garantir le droit de suivre un programme de formation pour se préparer en vue d’une nomination à un poste en vertu du paragraphe 4.1.1, et ce jusqu’à concurrence d’une (1) année ou de sa date de nomination à un autre poste, si celle-ci arrive plus tôt. La nomination à ce poste est assujettie au succès de la formation.\n\n##### 4.3 Personnes mises en disponibilité\n4.3.1La personne mise en disponibilité est admissible au recyclage, pourvu :\n  1. que cela s’impose pour faciliter sa nomination à un poste vacant donné;\n  2. qu’elle satisfasse aux exigences minimales précisées dans la norme de sélection applicable au groupe en cause;\n  3. qu’il n’existe aucune ou aucun autre bénéficiaire de priorité disponible qui ait les qualifications requises pour le poste;et\n**\n  1. que le ministère ou l’organisation d’accueil ne puisse justifier sa décision de ne pas la recycler.\n4.3.2Lorsqu’une personne se voit offrir une nomination assujettie à la réussite de son recyclage, le plan de recyclage est inclus dans la lettre d’offre. Si la personne accepte l’offre conditionnelle, elle est nommée pour une période indéterminée au plein niveau du poste après avoir mené son recyclage à bonne fin et avoir été jugée qualifiée pour le poste. Lorsqu’une personne accepte une nomination à un poste dont le taux de rémunération maximal est inférieur à celui du poste duquel elle a été mise en disponibilité, elle bénéficie d’une protection salariale, conformément aux dispositions de la partie V.\n\n#### Partie V : protection salariale\n\n##### 5.1 Poste d’un niveau inférieur\n5.1.1Le traitement et les rajustements effectués au titre de l’équité salariale des personnes salariées excédentaires et des personnes mises en disponibilité qui sont nommées à un poste d’un niveau inférieur au leur en vertu du présent appendice sont protégés par les dispositions de protection salariale de la présente convention collective ou, en l’absence de dispositions de ce genre, par les dispositions pertinentes de la Directive sur les conditions d’emploi.\n5.1.2La protection de salaire accordée en vertu du paragraphe 5.1.1 à la personne salariée demeure en vigueur jusqu’à ce que celle-ci soit nommée ou déplacée à un poste dont le taux maximum de rémunération est égal ou supérieur au taux maximum de rémunération du poste duquel elle a été déclarée excédentaire ou mise en disponibilité.\n\n#### Partie VI : options offertes aux personnes salariées\n\n##### 6.1 Généralités\n6.1.1Normalement, les administratrices générales ou les administrateurs généraux garantiront une offre d’emploi raisonnable à une personne salariée touchée pour laquelle elles ou ils savent qu’il existe ou elles ou ils peuvent prévoir une disponibilité d’emploi. L’administratrice générale ou l’administrateur général qui ne peut pas donner cette garantie indiquera ses raisons par écrit, à la demande de la personne salariée. La personne salariée qui reçoit une telle garantie ne se verra pas offrir le choix des options ci-dessous.\n6.1.2La personne salariée qui ne reçoit pas de garantie d’offre d’emploi raisonnable de l’administratrice générale ou l’administrateur général aura cent vingt (120) jours pour envisager les trois (3) options mentionnées plus bas avant de devoir prendre une décision.\nLa personne salariée peut aussi participer au processus d’échange de postes, conformément au paragraphe 6.3 du présent appendice dans les cent vingt (120) jours avant qu’elle ne doive prendre une décision aux termes de l’article 6.1.3.\n6.1.3La personne salariée optante doit présenter par écrit son choix de l’une des options énumérées au paragraphe 6.4 du présent appendice pendant la période de cent vingt (120) jours de réflexion. Elle ne peut changer d’option lorsqu’elle a fait son choix par écrit. Le ministère acheminera une copie du choix de la personne salariée à la présidente ou au président de l’IPFPC.\n6.1.4Si la personne salariée n’a pas fait de choix à la fin de la période de réflexion de cent vingt (120) jours, elle sera réputée avoir choisi l’option 6.4.1 (a), priorité de personne salariée excédentaire d’une durée de douze (12) mois pour trouver une offre d’emploi raisonnable.\n6.1.5Si une offre d’emploi raisonnable qui ne requiert pas de réinstallation est faite au cours de la période de cent vingt (120) jours de réflexion et avant l’acceptation par écrit de la MST ou de l’indemnité d’études, la personne salariée est inadmissible à ces options.\n**\n6.1.6Le ministère ou organisation doit faire parvenir sans délai à la présidente ou au président de l’IPFPC une copie de toute lettre qu’il aura envoyée en vertu de la présente partie ou de tout avis de mise en disponibilité émis conformément à la LEFP.\n\n##### 6.2 Programme de départ volontaire\nLe programme de départ volontaire aide les personnes salariées à quitter la fonction publique lorsqu’elles sont placées en statut touché avant de s’inscrire à un processus de sélection des personnes salariées aux fins de maintien en poste ou de mise en disponibilité (SMPMD), et ne s’applique pas si l’administratrice générale ou l’administrateur général peut fournir une garantie d’offre d’emploi raisonnable (GOER) aux personnes salariées touchées dans l’unité de travail.\n6.2.1Les ministères et les organisations mettent en place un programme de départ volontaire lors de chaque réaménagement des effectifs dans lequel la main-d’œuvre sera réduite et qui touche cinq personnes salariées ou plus de même groupe et niveau et de la même unité de travail et lorsque l’administratrice générale ou l’administrateur général ne peut pas fournir une garantie d’offre d’emploi raisonnable.\n6.2.2Lorsque ces programmes de départ volontaire sont mis en place, les personnes salariées, qui se portent volontaires et qui sont choisies, seront considérées comme personnes salariées optantes.\n6.2.3Lorsque le nombre de volontaires excède le nombre de postes à éliminer, la sélection des participantes et des participants se fera par ancienneté. Par ancienneté, on entend le nombre total d’années d’emploi dans la fonction publique fédérale, qu’elles soient ou non continues.\n\n##### 6.3 Échange de postes\n6.3.1Tous les ministères ou les organisations participeront au processus d’échanges de postes.\n**\n6.3.2Un échange a lieu lorsqu’une personne salariée optante ou une personne salariée excédentaire ayant choisi l’option 6.4.1 (a) qui préférerait rester dans l’administration publique centrale échange son poste avec une personne salariée non touchée (la personne salariée remplaçante) qui désire quitter l’administration publique centrale, conformément aux dispositions de la partie VI du présent appendice.\n6.3.3\n  1. Seule la personne salariée optante et excédentaire parce qu’elle a choisi l’option 6.4.1 (a) peut être affectée à un poste non touché à durée indéterminée au sein de l’administration publique centrale.\n  2. Lorsqu’une personne salariée dont le poste a été déclaré excédentaire, mais qui n’est pas une personne salariée optante, se voit offrir un échange de postes, la MST qui lui est offerte en vertu de l’alinéa 6.4.1 (b) ou du sous-alinéa 6.4.1 (c)(i) est réduite d’une (1) semaine pour chaque semaine complétée entre le début de la période de priorité de la personne salariée excédentaire et la date à laquelle l’échange de postes a été offert.\n**\n6.3.4Une personne salariée nommée pour une période indéterminée qui souhaite quitter l’administration publique centrale peut manifester l’intérêt d’échanger son poste avec celui d’une personne salariée optante ou une personne salariée excédentaire ayant choisi l’option 6.4.1 (a). Il incombe cependant à la direction de décider si la personne salariée optante répond aux exigences du poste de la personne salariée remplaçante et aux besoins de l’administration publique centrale.\n6.3.5Tout échange de postes doit se traduire par l’élimination d’une fonction ou d’un poste de façon permanente.\n**\n6.3.6La personne salariée optante ou une personne salariée excédentaire ayant choisi l’option 6.4.1 (a) qui prend la place d’une personne salariée non touchée doit, dans la mesure déterminée par l’employeur, répondre aux exigences du poste de cette dernière, y compris les exigences linguistiques. La personne salariée (la personne salariée remplaçante) qui prend la place d’une personne salariée optante doit répondre aux exigences du poste de cette dernière, sauf si elle n’effectue pas les fonctions de ce poste. La personne salariée remplaçante sera rayée de l’effectif dans les cinq (5) jours suivant l’échange de postes.\n6.3.7Un échange de postes doit habituellement avoir lieu entre des personnes salariées de mêmes groupe et niveau. Deux (2) personnes salariées qui ne sont pas des mêmes groupes et niveaux peuvent échanger leurs postes à condition que leurs groupes et niveaux soient considérés comme équivalents. C’est le cas lorsque l’écart entre le taux de rémunération maximal du poste assorti d’un traitement plus élevé et le taux de rémunération maximal du poste assorti d’un traitement moins élevé ne dépasse pas six pour cent (6 %).\n6.3.8L’échange a lieu à une date donnée, c’est-à-dire que les deux (2) personnes salariées concernées échangent directement leurs postes le même jour. L’échange ne doit pas donner lieu à une « réaction en chaîne », à savoir une série d’échanges entre plus de deux postes ou à un « examen ultérieur », à savoir un échange à une date ultérieure.\nPour plus de précision, l’échange de postes doit avoir lieu à une date donnée une fois qu’il a été approuvé, mais peut se faire après l’échéance de la période de cent vingt (120) jours en raison, par exemple, de la lenteur des processus administratifs.\n**\n6.3.9Si un échange de postes est rejeté, une rencontre pour discuter de la justification de la décision aura lieu à la demande de la personne salariée. La représentante ou le représentant de l’Institut peut assister à la réunion.\n\n##### 6.4 Options\n6.4.1Seule la personne salariée optante qui ne reçoit pas une garantie d’offre d’emploi raisonnable de son administratrice générale ou administrateur général aura le choix entre les options suivantes :\n  1. Une priorité de personne salariée excédentaire d’une durée de douze (12) mois pour trouver une offre d’emploi raisonnable. Si une offre d’emploi raisonnable n’est pas faite au cours de ces douze (12) mois, la personne salariée sera mise en disponibilité conformément à la LEFP. La personne salariée qui exerce cette option ou qui est présumée l’exercer est excédentaire;À la demande de la personne salariée, ladite période de priorité d’excédentaire d’une durée de douze (12) mois sera prolongée à l’aide de la partie inutilisée de la période de cent vingt (120) jours mentionnée au paragraphe 6.1.2 qui reste valide dès que la personne salariée a choisi par écrit l’option 6.4.1 (a);Lorsqu’une personne salariée excédentaire qui a choisi, ou est réputée avoir choisi, l’option 6.4.1 (a) propose de démissionner avant la fin de sa période de priorité d’excédentaire de douze (12) mois, l’administratrice générale ou l’administrateur général peut autoriser le versement d’un montant forfaitaire égal à sa rémunération à son poste d’attache pour le reste de la période de priorité d’excédentaire jusqu’à un maximum de six (6) mois. Le montant forfaitaire de rémunération en remplacement de la période excédentaire ne peut pas dépasser le maximum que la personne salariée aurait touché si elle avait choisi l’option 6.4.1 (b), la MST;Les ministères ou les organisations feront tout effort raisonnable pour placer une personne salariée excédentaire au cours de sa période de priorité d’excédentaire dans son secteur préféré de mobilité;ou\n  2. Une MST, à savoir un montant forfaitaire versé à la personne salariée optante. Le montant est calculé selon le nombre d’années de service au sein de la fonction publique (voir l’annexe B).

Lorsqu’une personne salariée excédentaire qui a choisi, ou est réputée avoir choisi, l’option 6.4.1 (a) propose de démissionner avant la fin de sa période de priorité d’excédentaire de douze (12) mois, l’administratrice générale ou l’administrateur général peut autoriser le versement d’un montant forfaitaire égal à sa rémunération à son poste d’attache pour le reste de la période de priorité d’excédentaire jusqu’à un maximum de six (6) mois. Le montant forfaitaire de rémunération en remplacement de la période excédentaire ne peut pas dépasser le maximum que la personne salariée aurait touché si elle avait choisi l’option 6.4.1 (b), la MST;\n  4. Les ministères ou les organisations feront tout effort raisonnable pour placer une personne salariée excédentaire au cours de sa période de priorité d’excédentaire dans son secteur préféré de mobilité;ou\n**\n  1. Une indemnité d’études, qui correspond à la MST (voir option 6.4.1 (b) ci-dessus) plus un montant n’excédant pas dix-sept mille dollars (17 000 $) pour le remboursement des frais de scolarité d’un établissement d’enseignement et les frais de livres et d’équipement pertinents, appuyés par un reçu.La personne salariée choisissant l’option 6.4.1 (c) peut :démissionner de l’administration publique centrale et recevoir une indemnité de départ au taux de mise en disponibilité le jour de sa cessation d’emploi.

personnes salariées peuvent recevoir une prime de maintien en fonction dans trois (3) situations : la fermeture totale d’une installation, la réinstallation d’unités de travail et la diversification des modes d’exécution.\n6.5.2Toutes les personnes salariées qui acceptent une prime de maintien en fonction doivent accepter de quitter l’administration publique centrale en renonçant à tous leurs droits de priorité.\n6.5.3La personne qui a touché une prime de maintien en fonction et qui, le cas échéant, est nommée de nouveau, dans un secteur de l’administration publique centrale, que spécifie

optimisation des possibilités d’emploi offertes aux personnes salariées.\nLes parties reconnaissent :\n  • le besoin du syndicat de représenter les personnes salariées au cours du processus de transition;\n  • le besoin de l’employeur de jouir d’une plus grande souplesse dans l’organisation de l’administration publique centrale.\n\n##### 7.1 Définitions\nPour l’application de la présente partie,diversification des modes d’exécution(alternative delivery initiative) désigne le transfert d’une activité ou entreprise de l’administration publique centrale à une entité ou corporation qui constitue un organisme distinct ou qui ne fait pas partie de l’administration publique centrale.\nPour l’application de la présente partie,offre d’emploi raisonnable(reasonable job offer) désigne l’offre d’emploi faite par un nouvel employeur, qui répond aux critères énoncés au paragraphe 7.2.2 qui s’appliquent aux formules de transition de catégories 1 et 2.\nPour l’application de la présente partie, on entend parlicenciement de la personne salariée(termination of employment) le fait de mettre fin à un emploi conformément à l’alinéa 12(1)(f) de la LGFP.\n\n##### 7.2 Généralités\nLes ministères ou les organisations donnent avis à la présidente ou au président de l’Institut le plus tôt possible après avoir pris la décision de donner suite à une initiative de diversification des modes d’exécution (DME), et si possible, au moins cent quatre-vingts (180) jours avant la date du transfert.\nL’avis à l’Institut comprendra : 1) le programme à l’étude aux fins de diversification, 2) la raison de la DME, et 3) le genre d’approche prévue pour la diversification.\n**\nUn comité conjoint de réaménagement des effectifs et de diversification des modes d’exécution (RE DME) sera mis sur pied et sera composé d’une représentation égale du Ministère ou de l’organisation et de l’Institut. Si les parties en conviennent mutuellement, d’autres participantes ou participants pourront faire partie du comité. Le comité conjoint RE DME définira les règles de fonctionnement du comité.\n**\nDans le cas des initiatives de DME, les parties mettront sur pied un comité conjoint RE DMES afin de mener des consultations efficaces sur les questions de ressources humaines liées à l’initiative de DME en vue de fournir de l’information à la personne salariée et pour l’aider à déterminer si elle doit ou non accepter l’offre d’emploi.\n  1. CommercialisationDans les cas de commercialisation accompagnée d’appels d’offres, les parties feront tous les efforts raisonnables pour s’entendre sur les critères liés aux questions de ressources humaines (c’est-à-dire, les conditions d’emploi, les prestations de retraite, le régime de soins de santé, le nombre de personnes salariées à être embauchées) à être utilisés dans la demande de propositions (DP). Les parties respecteront les procédures sur les marchés du gouvernement fédéral.\n  2. Création d’un nouvel organismeDans le cas de la création d’un nouvel organisme, les parties feront tout effort raisonnable pour s’entendre sur des recommandations communes liées aux questions de ressources humaines (c’est-à-dire, les conditions d’emploi, les prestations de retraite, le régime de soins de santé) qui devraient être disponibles à la date du transfert.\n  3. Transfert à des employeurs actuelsDans toutes les autres initiatives de DME où il existe déjà des relations employeur-personne salariée, les parties tiendront des consultations sérieuses afin de préciser les conditions d’emploi qui s’appliqueront après le transfert.Dans les cas de commercialisation et de création de nouveaux organismes, on offrira des possibilités de consultation à l’Institut. Toutefois, si après des consultations raisonnables aucune entente n’intervient, le ministère ira de l’avant et fera le transfert.\nDans les cas de commercialisation accompagnée d’appels d’offres, les parties feront tous les efforts raisonnables pour s’entendre sur les critères liés aux questions de ressources humaines (c’est-à-dire, les conditions d’emploi, les prestations de retraite, le régime de soins de santé, le nombre de personnes salariées à être embauchées) à être utilisés dans la demande de propositions (DP).

Le nouvel employeur instaurera ou Sa Majesté du chef du Canada obligera le nouvel employeur à instaurer des régimes de pension raisonnables en prévision du transfert des personnes salariées. Le critère du « caractère raisonnable » prévoira que la valeur actuarielle (coût) des dispositions de pension du nouvel employeur représente au moins six virgule cinq pour cent (6,5 %) des frais de personnel ouvrant droit à pension ce qui dans le cas d’un régime de pension à prestation déterminée sera calculé en utilisant la méthodologie d’évaluation mise au point par Towers Perrin pour le Conseil du Trésor et datée du 7 octobre 1997. Cette méthodologie d’évaluation s’appliquera pendant la durée de la présente convention collective. Dans les cas où aucun régime de pension raisonnable n’aura été instauré au moment du transfert ou lorsque le nouvel employeur n’aura pris aucun engagement écrit d’instaurer un régime de pension raisonnable de la sorte à la date où s’effectuera le transfert, sous réserve de l’approbation du Parlement et de la prise d’un engagement par écrit par le nouvel employeur de verser les coûts de l’employeur, la protection prévue par laLoi sur la pension dans la fonction publique(LPFP) pourra être assurée pendant une période de transition maximale d’un (1) an.\n  2. Les prestations relatives au service accumulé jusqu’au moment du transfert seront entièrement protégées.\n  3. Dans les cas où il n’existera aucune entente en matière de transférabilité, Sa Majesté du chef du Canada verra à conclure les ententes de transférabilité entre le régime de pension de la fonction publique et le régime de pension du nouvel employeur. De plus, Sa Majesté du chef du Canada verra à obtenir l’autorisation d’offrir aux personnes salariées la possibilité de compter leur période de service fourni au nouvel employeur aux fins du calcul des seuils d’acquisition et des seuils de prestation prévus sous le régime de la LPFP.\n\n#### Annexe B : mesure de soutien à la transition\n\n| Années de service au sein de la fonction publique | Mesure de soutien à la transition (MST) (paiement en semaines de rémunération) |\n| --- | --- |\n| 0 | 10 |\n| 1 | 22 |\n| 2 | 24 |\n| 3 | 26 |\n| 4 | 28 |\n| 5 | 30 |\n| 6 | 32 |\n| 7 | 34 |\n| 8 | 36 |\n| 9 | 38 |\n| 10 | 40 |\n| 11 | 42 |\n| 12 | 44 |\n| 13 | 46 |\n| 14 | 48 |\n| 15 | 50 |\n| 16 | 52 |\n| 17 | 52 |\n| 18 | 52 |\n| 19 | 52 |\n| 20 | 52 |\n| 21 | 52 |\n| 22 | 52 |\n| 23 | 52 |\n| 24 | 52 |\n| 25 | 52 |\n| 26 | 52 |\n| 27 | 52 |\n| 28 | 52 |\n| 29 | 52 |\n| 30 | 49 |\n| 31 | 46 |\n| 32 | 43 |\n| 33 | 40 |\n| 34 | 37 |\n| 35 | 34 |\n| 36 | 31 |\n| 37 | 28 |\n| 38 | 25 |\n| 39 | 22 |\n| 40 | 19 |\n| 41 | 16 |\n| 42 | 13 |\n| 43 | 10 |\n| 44 | 07 |\n| 45 | 04 |\nPour les personnes salariées saisonnières ou à temps partiel embauchées pour une période indéterminée, la MST sera calculée au prorata de la même façon que l’indemnité de départ conformément à la présente convention collective.\nLes dispositions relatives à l’indemnité de départ de la présente convention collective s’ajoutent à la MST.\n\n#### **Annexe C : rôle de la CFP dans l’administration des droits de priorité des personnes salariées excédentaires et des personnes mises en disponibilité\n  1.

Les parties conviennent que les possibilités identifiées n’entraîneront pas de changements dans l’application, la portée ou la valeur;\n  • de comparer les interactions entre les conventions collectives et le Régime d’assurance-emploi et le Régime québécois d’assurance parentale.\nLe comité mixte sera composé d’un nombre égal de représentantes ou représentants de l’employeur et de l’Institut. Le comité mixte se réunira dans les quatre-vingt-dix (90) jours suivant la signature de la convention collective et s’efforcera de compléter la révision et de faire rapport à leurs exécutifs au plus tard un (1) an après la signature de cette convention collective. Cet échéancier peut être prolongé sur accord mutuel.\nCompte tenu de l’engagement commun des parties à l’égard de ces efforts continus, elles peuvent, d’un commun accord, se prévaloir de l’article 48 si une révision s’avérait nécessaire.\nCe protocole d’entente expire à la date d’expiration de cette convention collective.\n© Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le président du Conseil du Trésor, 2023,ISSN: 978-0-660-69843-4\n\n## Détails de la page\n\n## À propos de ce site\n\n### Secrétariat du Conseil du Trésor du Canada (SCT)\n  • Contactez-nous\n  • Formulaires\n\n### Gouvernement du Canada\n  • Toutes les coordonnées\n  • Ministères et organismes\n  • À propos du gouvernement\n\n#### Thèmes et sujets\n  • Emplois\n  • Immigration et citoyenneté\n  • Voyage et tourisme\n  • Entreprises\n  • Prestations\n  • Santé\n  • Impôts\n  • Environnement et ressources naturelles\n  • Sécurité nationale et défense\n  • Culture, histoire et sport\n  • Services de police, justice et urgences\n  • Transport et infrastructure\n  • Le Canada et le monde\n  • Argent et finances\n  • Science et innovation\n  • Autochtones\n  • Vétérans et militaires\n  • Jeunesse\n  • Gérer les événements de la vie\n\n### Organisation du gouvernement du Canada\n  • Médias sociaux\n  • Applications mobiles\n  • À propos de Canada.ca\n  • Avis\n  • Confidentialité"
